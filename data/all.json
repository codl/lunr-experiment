Here is my new track, took quite a bit to finish as I had some stuff for university to do and such, but it's finally here!\r\n\r\nI tried to make something a bit different. It's trance again, but it has some kind of a happy, yet dark feel to it. I personally am not all THAT happy how it turned out, but I hope you like it... :)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to ZwiRzu (http://zwirzu.deviantart.com/) for the Princess Luna vector! :D"

It's pretty long track at that, which is rather unheard of for me. Hopefully it won't bore you stiff, though!\r\n\r\nThis is a remix of StormWolf's amazing original piece, The Beginning of Order. I recommend you listen to the original right now! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIIGf7p4Aw\r\n\r\nI also mashed in King Dedede's recurring theme from the Kirby series, and a few other jingles.

Finally a new track! I was quite flooded with exams and stuff at the university, so there was a slight pause between new stuff. :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is my remix of the song Becoming Popular from the last episode. I have mixed feelings about the vocals and how I implemented them, so I am providing a download for an instrumental version as well! This track is a bit more electro-trance.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n\r\nThe original song \"Becoming Popular\" belongs to Daniel Ingram and Hasbro!"

LunaticBone: http://youtube.com/user/LunaticBone\r\n\r\nVerbatim:\r\n\"After suffering dozens of humiliating defeats, Cirno sets out to make herself stronger by challenging every opponent she comes across. Discovering a dimensional rift near the edge of Gensokyo, she wanders into Equestria, hoping to find some new challengers. These colorful ponies are just more target practice to her, and she begins a great freezeover, shrouding the inhabitants in ice and snow. Can the Elements of Harmony come together once more to combat the strongest foe Equestria has ever known?\r\n\r\nThis song originally began as a little injoke between me and HertzDevil, referring to Interrobang Pie's series of \"Invade\" remixes and Hertz's Cirno fetish. But after realizing that it was a fantastic opportunity for an immense collaboration project, Hertz got quickly to work and we developed it into what is now a deadly 8-minute reincarnation of Interrobang Pie himself.\r\n\r\nThis is a remix of WoodenToaster's track \"She's A Pony\". Since the 23rd is his birthday, I suppose you could consider this a birthday present!\"\r\n\r\nAnd yes. Quinton Miller is BACK.

My 500th subscriber was Bartekko (http://www.youtube.com/user/bartekkko), go visit him now!\r\n\r\nOkay, for this original track, I decided to go towards a bit more harder side of trance. We all know how Applejack is strong and all, yet loyal and can fill your heart with warmth. My idea was to try and describe this using contrasts in my track between beautiful and full-out dark. The track is mostly inspired by the episode \"Applebuck Season\". Whole intro of the track describes Applejack getting ready for the Applebuck Season. She is determined to succeed. The moment when the drop happens is the moment where she begins her hard work. I tried to simulate her raw energy and willpower in the drop.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!"

So I thought about other pony when I was making a corrections and bingo - I found one! \r\nWhat can I say... Track is gentle and soft - like a flower. And I like Roseluck...

Some producers in here might notice I used a sample for the pad. I am not all that good with creating melodies, and when I heard the sample, I simply WANTED to use it. To compensate for this, I tried layering more synths over the original sample to somewhat mask it... Maybe being my first \"original\" track, you can somehow look past it.\r\n\r\nI still hate myself for using the sample.\r\n\r\nAnyway, now that we got over the painful and shameful part of this track, we can actually discuss it!\r\nObviously, Fluttershy was my inspiration. Don't say it doesn't have anything to do with ponies because it is an INSPIRED track. Just a little idea I had... I just thought a trance track would nicely fit with the cuteness that is Fluttershy! :)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to kurokaji11 (http://kurokaji11.deviantart.com/) for the vector of Fluttershy sleeping! :)"

That is the story of Nightmare Moon...\r\nI don't know if this is the inspiration Makkon originally had, but it is how I saw the track... :)\r\nMakkon's original is simply fantastic. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard it the first time. After I \"recovered\", I thought, how would it sound like trance?\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Makkon ( http://www.youtube.com/user/makkon06 ) for making one of the best classical/film music compositions in the community!\r\n\r\nThe amazing picture used in artwork was made by C-Puff ( http://c-puff.deviantart.com/ ). You should definitely go check out her work!"

Amazing artist right there.\r\n\r\n0:00-0:20\r\n\r\nThe first 20 seconds bring us to Daring Do, standing in front of the temple with bated breath, no way to know what lies inside. She takes her first steps inside the temple\r\n\r\n0:21-2:00\r\n\r\nDaring Do cautiously makes her way through the temple, studying the cryptic signs on the walls before her. She realizes, in a rather harsh manner, that the place she is in does not want her there. Her dance through the temple, narrowly avoiding death at every corner, begins.\r\n\r\n2:01-2:20\r\n\r\nDaring Do finds the treasure she's been seeking, and is filled with joy. However...\r\n\r\n2:20-3:12\r\n\r\nThe temple begins to collapse around Daring Do, and suddenly she has to think fast, or burn. She narrowly escapes death by lava, and breathes a sigh of relief as she climbs with her life. However, her relief is short lived...\r\n\r\n3:12-4:00\r\n\r\nDaring Do is captured by her evil nemesis, Ahuizotl. Suddenly, she realizes that burning to death would have been preferable over what she was about to experience at the hands of Ahuizotl. \r\n\r\n4:00-End\r\n\r\nDaring Do once again, narrowly escapes with her life. Our heroine then swiftly retrieves the Sapphire Statue from Ahuizotl, prevailing victorious once again.\r\n\r\nThe end. Hope you enjoyed!"

        "description": "Another little MLP Song about the spell Celestia used to send Nightmare Moon to the moon, and what might have become of that forbidden magic. I know I'm writing music about outdated MLP material, considering Season 2 is well on it's way, but when it comes to music, inspiration is a strange little thing that never works how you want it to.\r\n\r\nAlso, Special thanks to DreamHuk, (http://www.youtube.com/user/DreamHuK), one of the artists from The Beatle Bronies. (http://www.youtube.com/user/BeatleBrony)\r\n\r\nHe made the vocals, so thanks a lot! =)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nIn the Canterlot Library,\r\nLies the forbidden spell.\r\nLocked away in the darkest corner,\r\nWhere the evil books dwell.\r\n\r\nOnly used but one time,\r\nNot to be used again.\r\nIf anypony found it now,\r\nWoe to ponyfolk then.\r\n\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nNever to come back again.\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nSee how glad they are then.\r\n\r\nSend Ponies you don't like,\r\nSend those who cause you pain.\r\nThough it has been hidden away,\r\nGo ahead and use it in vain!\r\n\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nNever to come back again.\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nSee how glad they are then.\r\n\r\nIn only a few years,\r\nJust imagine the scene.\r\nA great and powerful pony finds it,\r\nShe'll do more than just turn their mane green! She'll...\r\n\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nNever to come back again.\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nSee how glad they are then.\r\n\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nNever to come back again.\r\nSend them to the moon,\r\nSee how glad they are then."

        "description": "\"EEK!\", yelled Fluttershy as the dragon flame engulfed her flank, her yellow and smooth fur turning black and charred with a hiss. \r\nWith a loud thud, she hit the ground, cringing and crying. \r\n\"Fluttershy darling!\", Rarity screamed as she ran towards the hurt pegasus. Blood smoothly seeped out of the black wound, coloring Fluttershys fur the tint of a ripe tomato. \r\nRarity tore of a piece of her dress with tears in her eyes. She slammed it against the wound, making the young pegasus scream a chilling scream.\r\nThe rest of Raritys dress was covered in traces of blood, weither it was her own or dragon blood Twilight didn't know. She hoped it was the latter.\r\n\"Twilight, we need to retreat! We are sitting ducks out her!\", Rainbow Dash screamed at the lavender unicorn. \r\nTwilight knew Dash was correct; out here in the open they were going to be decimated by the dragons sooner or later, no matter what they did. Retreating was an option; an option that would \r\nmean the destruction of Ponyville... and it's citizens.\r\n\r\nShe was a good leader and strategist in normal cases. When questions related to her friends small problems, she never hesitated. She always knew what she had to say. \r\nShe was never good at big questions.\r\n\r\n\"No Dash. I am afraid we can't do that.\", she said, feeling tears bubbling up inside of her. She was afraid; afraid she wouldn't se Celestia, Luna or anyone else again.\r\n \"If we go, Ponyville will be destroyed. The citizen will die. \"\r\nSilence. In the distance you could hear the dragons roaring. It echoed. \r\n\"We need to buy Celestia and her troops more time to get to Ponyville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prepare yourself girls. We make our final stand here!\" \r\n\r\nThe story above is what i thought of when i made this song. Tried to mix three genres in this song; metal, orchestral and electronical. (A bit lacking on the metal part, according to me)\r\nThis is the second war or combat related song i've made in a row now, so i'll probably lay low on those for some time. Something happy and upbeat will probably be next.\r\n"

So this song is kind of about that :)\r\n\r\nThis was a sort of experiment, to see how would you master a song on Dr Drum, so I didn't use any filters or additional EQ, only panning, volume, low, high and mid bands (no ajusting), no automations as well, just a simple fade-in effect.\r\n\r\nA bit slower this time, but hopefully should be still good :)\r\n\r\nCredits given where credit's due:\r\n\r\nOriginal art by BlackM3sh: http://blackm3sh.deviantart.com/gallery/31480814#/d3g0y4i\r\n\r\nArt: http://i.imgur.com/an2gc.jpg\r\n\r\n-CS\r\n"

Until today.\r\nSo this time you'll see Princess Luna on the Canterlot's Palace balcony. She is focus to cover the Sun and raise the beautiful Moon. But the night must be perfect. Luna is an artist. Everything must be perfect... The brightness of the Moon, position of the stars, colorful auroras, dark color of the sky... The clouds slightly lighted by the Moon. And thousands of lamps around the Canterlot. Yes... this night will be perfect."

Where it is still a little bit scary and mysterious, but that's it. It has lovely weather, sunlights hits between the swishing leaves, birds and crickets are singing all over. Just an ordinary forest with some secrets like abandoned castle or some creepy trees.\r\nDo you like that vision?"

I finally made the last track from the EP \"Walls of Canterlot\" - here you have a title track.\r\nCanterlot is such a beautiful place. It was built by magic of unicorns on the flank of the mountain. Thanks to their spells it has that amazing shape - a lot of towers and walls, gardens and canals, and a waterfalls too! About that is my track. About that beautiful place where our princesses live. About its evergreen gardens and trees with chirping birds, about flowers which sow an amazing aromas. About that small brick streets and alleys. About magnificent royal castle with many gold copings. And, of course, that tune is about walls. Gorgeous white walls.\r\nThe track at the beginning is kinda sad... Because I think that our palace has its victims... Making building with magic can be exhausting and for somepony can be deadly... Sad melody is my tribute for all of them. And the horns in the end? That's the voice of royal wedding. "

This song is supposed to be a theme for a bossfight against the villain David from CardsLafter's amazing MLP:FiM Fanfic, Through the Eyes of Another Pony. I figured that since the fight would take place in a cathedral, it better have a good organ. Then I couldn't find a good organ, and had to settle for a Cello. Octavia, eat your heart out.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the song is my first piece I've made in Linux Multimedia Studio, and really is my first foray into the world of writing my own music rather than singing or playing what somebody else wrote. Feel free to give out constructive criticism, scathing critiques, or glowing gushing sessions here, the youtube page, or on the deviantart page linked above.\r\n\r\nA massive thankyou to CardsLafter:, ToastWaffle, and lightningfast for alpha and then beta testing my song, telling me what sucked and how to fix it. I couldn't have done this nearly this well without you guys.\r\n\r\nAnd if anybody's looking for someone to blame for unleashing me onto the world of music creation, the person responsible is CardsLafter. He said since I was so into music I should make my own, and that surely there's a good quality music making program out there (legitimately) for free. He was right, and he has doomed us all.\r\n\r\nFun fact: All of the software used cost me a grand total of $0. Even the extra VSTi's I picked up were freeware.\r\n\r\nThe cover art: The sparkly cloud int the top-left corner is a chunk of Nightmare Moon's mane, which was included to reference the Nightmare. In the bottom left corner, we have a flame for Firewall. On the right, we have the rose that I drew for Mother's Day, because I figured David would be the kind of guy to grow those impossibly easy to kill things (they die from disease and pests at the drop of a hat), being sophisticated and all that. That, and Firewall hates roses with a burning passion. (ROSEBUSH?! Kill it with fire!)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use either the song or my album art, in whole or in part, that's perfectly fine with me! Just be sure to credit me, link back to this page, the youtube page, or the DeviantArt page, and drop me a link to wherever you used it. Also, it'd be nice if you asked for permission first. ;)"

A youth in revolt!!'\r\n\r\nBut the fact was I'ma a stallion with a mind of my own,\r\nand if you disagree with me you better leave me the hay alone,\r\nCause I'm somepony who should NOT be f****** with,\r\nDo anything I want, whatever the hay I feel, b****!\r\n\r\nAnd so, you can see, that I mighta had some trouble\r\nwith the Canterlot police department, one too many times,\r\nbut the reason I was 86'd was somethin' altogether different,\r\nsomethin'  even worse than all my many minor crimes...\r\n\r\n\r\nI helped an old mare to cross a busy street,\r\nshe was hunched and frail, she was wrinkly and pale,\r\nshe was carrying a saddle bag full of mail,\r\nBut turns out my good deed was full of fail,\r\n\r\ncause that old-a** mare wasn't old at all,\r\nshe was in disguise havin' robbed a jewelry store,\r\nso when the po-leece came, they took me as well,\r\nsaid I'd helped to plan the job, and I was doomed as h***!!\r\n\r\nBut a Good-a** lawyer can save your life,\r\nI just got the hoof instead of doin' time,\r\nI was 86'd to a tiny-a** town,\r\nthey call it Pony-ville...\r\n\r\n...and now I'm stuck here with nothin in the world to do but just hang around at home all day like some common f***** mule... No offense, but I miss my city and all my friends and all the places I used to go... man, my luck must absolutely....."

I decided to join the guys who work on an MLP RPG game called \"Elegy of Disharmony\" and make soundtrack for their game! This is the first track for the game, and there will be many more, so stay tuned!\r\n\r\nThis one is Everfree Forest themed (it will be background music for the zone). It is meant to be dark, scary and ambiental. Yep, this is not trance, but more something like a blend of orchestral and ambiental. \r\n\r\nFunfact: The very distorted and stuttered sound you can hear at places like 1:03 is actually Rainbow Dash's voice.\r\n\r\nHope you like it! :D\r\n\r\nThe artwork was drawn by one of the team members, Cadet-J ( http://cadet-j.deviantart.com/ )"

I wanted the song to be unique, or a bit different then the rest of the other electronical stuff\r\nyou can find out there, and thus i focused alot on melodies and to make sure the whole song was rather melodical and video game-esque, and not just a bass line and a drum pattern.\r\n\r\nI think this would fit pretty well in a Mega Man or a Mega Man x game, no?"

WoodenToaster has graciously let me create the full MIDI of this ever-popular song. This particular version of the song, however, features this full MIDI, but with some tweaks to instrumentation and added effects to give it a new and unique feel. No this version is not a complete copy of the original as the originals vocals are also 100% instrumental in this version (do note that this version is also notated quite accurately as well).\r\n\r\nInstrument Changes:\r\nPiano to Harpsicord; Bass Lead Synths to Power Chord Guitar; and Vocals to Alto Saxophone, Harmony Pad and Bagpipes.\r\nInstruments Added (double of original, changed to another instrument):\r\nSpace Lead, Mixed Chior, Square Lead, and Slicer Lead.\r\nEffects Added:\r\nReverb, Phaser, and Delay.\r\n\r\nNormally I have composition idea spree on the Weekend, but this week's topic just didn't click for me this time around. So instead I decided to use one of my older projects and change it up a bit. The fact that I am bringing back Rainbow Factory covers the revival aspect of this entry. I am not infringing on any copyright grounds as this is a MIDI instrumental mix, and that WoodenToaster has allowed me to recreate the full song entirely as a MIDI.\r\n\r\nI would also like to personally thank zorg for graciously recreating the percussion of the song, the only weak aspect of my ability to recreate songs.\r\n\r\nIf you forgot the Lyrics or just want to follow along with the instruments that take the place of the vocals:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNow a rainbow's tale isn't quite as nice\r\nas the story we knew of sugar and spice,\r\nBut a rainbow's easy once you get to know it,\r\nWith the help of the magic of a Pegasus Device\r\n\r\nNow let's delve deeper into rainbow philosophy,\r\nfar beyond that of Cloudsdale's mythology.\r\nit's easy to misjudge that floating city,\r\nwith it's alluring decor and social psychology.\r\nBut with all great things comes a great responsibility,\r\nThat of Cloudsdale's being weather stability.\r\n\"How\", you ask, \"are they up to the task?\",\r\nto which the answer is in a simple facility\r\n\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true.\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through.\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true.\r\n\r\n(Instrumental)\r\n\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true.\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through.\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true.\r\nIn the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCheck out the Story inspired by the Song, written by AuroraDawn: \r\nhttps://www.fanfiction.net/s/8942390/1/Original-Rainbow-Factory\r\nCheck out the movie inspired by the story, currently under production: \r\nhttps://rfamp.tumblr.com\r\nListen to the original submission of the song: \r\nhttp://toastbeard.bronyradio.com/a/ZIQ06/\r\nWant the normal FULL MIDI?

Call Pinkie pie. \r\nThe Laugh Element, Master of Smiles - Chuckle Development. \r\nFourth wall breaking, and making physics irrelevent. \r\nThe way i'm tellin it, ain't no reason you shouldn't meet her... \r\nBut, you break a Pinkie Promise? And honestly? Couldn't beat her. \r\nTry to run, make an excuse, or vanish into vapor \r\nCause the promise that you broke makes it certain you can't escape her. \r\nBut the madness she possesses goes deeper than broken promises \r\nThe depths we'll have to go will be darker and far beyond the mysts \r\nWhat I speak of's the one they call Pinkamena. \r\nGray tint, straight hair, just pray you never meet her. \r\nMeaner than the most deviant beings you've ever seen. \r\nPinkamena is the Nightmare if Pinkie Pie is the Dream. \r\nDon't accept an invitation, and flatly lie in her face. \r\nWatch her face drain of color, her eyes stare into space. \r\nAnd you find as friend, you have suddenly been replaced. \r\nBy a bag of flour, or some rocks stacked in a vase. \r\nThat is just a taste, to the terror that she can make. \r\nHave you ever read the fan-based fiction called Cupcakes? \r\nYeah. \r\nDemented twisted and bent, vindictive misfit and spent \r\nher time dismembering Dash into ingredients. \r\nImmediate evacuation of the facility \r\nWhen Pinkamena Diane Pie is in the building. \r\nAnd I got a feeling after the babysitting she'd been through. \r\nPumpkin and Pound Baby Cakes is on the Menu. \r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS \r\n\r\n\r\nSPROCKET: \r\nTwilight, you ain't exactly one who should talk \r\nYou could lose your marbles over blackboard and chalk \r\nYour ambitions are fine till they come crumbling down \r\nThen in sedition you rise against the good of the whole town \r\nWe all admire your scholastical strengths - fantastical lengths you take refining practical brains \r\nBut you know how you can tell that you been missing the point? \r\nWhen you unleash more chaos than when Discord ran the joint! \r\nEven Derpy set to bring on the pain \r\nAnd rain down the wrath of agression unrestrained \r\nOver a doll - now that's what I call insane \r\nAlthough I must admit I really really like her mane. \r\nIt's tragic, the element of magic is crackin' \r\nTown's manic, load up the paddywagon. \r\nFrom Manehattan the toughest streets in the world \r\nAnd there ain't nothing scarier than hearing \"Hello Girls\" \r\n\r\nMC FLOWNY: That wasn't scary, Twilight's under mad stress. \r\n\r\nSPROCKET: Well, your cupcake story was a Fictional Fan Press. \r\n\r\nMC FLOWNY: And what, Fluttershy's shed is something Hasbro thought up? \r\n\r\nSPROCKET: Well, um..sorta. Not exactly, You see...shut up! \r\nAlright, so the ponies ain't as mad as they seem \r\n\r\nMC FLOWNY: And that's because they always dream of being nobler beings. \r\nWhat holds you together as your world is falling apart? \r\n\r\nSPROCKET: The magic of friendship living up in your heart. \r\n\r\nMC FLOWNY: So even though they get a little crazy up in a bind. \r\n\r\nSPROCKET: Their friendship magically untangles it every time. \r\n\r\nMC FLOWNY: So in otherwords, anyone can lose it just a little. \r\n\r\nSPROCKET: As long as they have friends, it pull's em back in the middle. \r\n\r\nMC FLOWNY: It'll be a mess if Ponies had to do it all alone. \r\n\r\nSPROCKET: Which is the moral of these stories to Bronies out on their own. \r\nJust remember we're together when facing all of these menaces. \r\n\r\nSPROCKET & FLOWNY: 'Cause friends help friends FINISH UP each others' SENTENCES.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS/FINALE \r\nThe cure to insanity doesn't require a prescription \r\n'Cause the cure to insanity is friendship. \r\nWord! \r\nScientists suspect that friendship is made out of magic."

And after I found a pic made by CSImadmax, I knew I must dedicate that track to her.\r\nThis track is, in fact, my imagination of Celestia's niece. I think she will be nice and kind, very feminine and also dynamic. She looks young, after all xd At least she's younger than Celestia and Luna. And I'm quite sure that her light pink coat may suggest she is not so powerful... And I've got a hunch that she will be a kick-assing flying unicorn xd\r\nIn 21.04.2012 we'll see if my suggestion was correct or not.\r\n\r\nWhy \"kites\"? I think that's a small gift from ponies to the newly-weds xd Something like a wish of propitious winds in their life.\r\n***\r\n***\r\n***\r\nDOWNLOAD MP3 (320kbps): http://www.mediafire.com/?1bsg4lbz940byph\r\n***\r\n***\r\n***\r\nGENRE: Chillout\r\nBPM: 84"

However, since we've only seen a few seconds of him, it is rather hard to know how he's actually like. \r\nIn my mind, he is a happy pony, one that always smiles and cracks jokes. But, he is also rather \"weird\", or special. Some ponies have a hard time actually spending time with him,\r\nsimply because he isn't like the others. He is sort of cheesy, in a \"weird\" way.\r\nThat's what i think about him atleast. I tried to compose this song after what i had in mind, trying to make the song a bit weird, special or just unusual.\r\nAlso tried to make it a bit video game-esque; lightly inspired by Crash Bandicot.

        "description": "This is my take on the Diamond Dogs over the Glitch Mob's 'Animus Vox'\r\n\r\nIn regards to 'Animus Vox': So I took the short intro, used the \"rappy\" part which went right into the \"choral\" part, added ANOTHER \"rappy\" part, and then added the ending. That makes sense, right?\r\n\r\nLyrics: \r\nBeneath the earth under the dirt / below the subterranean passages\r\npast the masses of the black facets / It is the land hid in the back\r\nBeyond the track, deep into the depths of the darkest of all paths. \r\n\r\nWe are a race of ravenous wrath beings.\r\nSome fast feeding, furious mad heaving get that ass beaten.. \r\nAnd that's meaning you passed the first meeting, and by pass\r\nI mean you last - the rip & thrash greeting. \r\n\r\nOur calling cards are shards of gems - bound around our necks. \r\nEmbedded in leather, a sign of respect.\r\nAnd the better and more precious a gem is.\r\nThe more venomous and more likely to wreck - that veteran is. \r\n\r\nAnd we are pack minded. Meaning Omegas straight attack \r\nWhile the Alphas plan ahead designing trap mines.\r\nThese fine devices devised by wry bastards. \r\nAnd you will find in these Mine Shafts - divine Masters \r\n\r\nWe the diamond dogs, our dog diamonds\r\nglimmer underneath the dim of Earth and keep shining.\r\nSo keep an eye on your rocks, or you'll get rocked on. \r\nThese dogs are off of the leash, and you'll get dogged on. \r\n\r\nWho let the dogs out?\r\nWho let the dogs out?\r\nWho let the dogs out?\r\nWe let the dogs out! \r\n\r\nBetter climb if you find yourself lost here. \r\nWe the canines that dine upon your heart's fear. \r\n\r\nI won't stop you, becoming self independent. \r\nIf you want to venture into the pit, then go ahead and \r\nDon't blame me if you fall off a cliff or get beheaded. \r\nCause you Dance with the Dogs - admit - your life has ended. \r\n\r\nBeen in the clutches of the dogs before. \r\nI've seen their fury underground like they gods of war. \r\nSoulless beasts who can gorge and feast upon the living. \r\nCerberus has a far better chance to be forgiving\r\nNow, there is another who survived this feat.. \r\nAn urban legend of girl who connived and schemed.\r\nInstead of pleading for her life, she decides to treat \r\nthem to a mind trick, and in the end defies their greed.\r\n\r\nA rare breed of a beautiful sly manipulator. \r\nAnd confined as a prisoner, doesn't try to escape\r\nBuys time with confusion, until her friends can save her \r\nWhen in fact, it's the dogs whose dying to separate her. \r\n\r\n//CHORUS//\r\n\r\nIt's a rare case, so - let it marinate. \r\nGo tell your pony friends - that this Mare's great. \r\nGo share that Diamond Dogs got all their nerves grated. \r\nAnd that one pony was more than they anticipated.\r\n\r\nAnd that within one day she was the most hated. \r\nAnd that this chance occurence was truly ill fated.\r\nAnd that a pony's whining is simply understated. \r\nA Rarity indeed - it cannot be debated. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nhttp://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/309/7/a/diamond_dogs_are_gonna_getcha_...\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17PM-UMVud8\r\nhttp://el-grimlock.deviantart.com/art/Werewolf-Warrior-255138248"

She fooled everypony, including Celestia herself. She showed her power in the fight agaist Tia. I didn't see that comming, I mean... I knew Chrysalis will won but in that style? Anyway, this track should be more dark, but... that's mainstream. She is dark and we already know it. I want to show you her beauty and magnificent. The track is also fast and a little bit agressive like her actions.\r\nThis track can also symbolize the destruction of Canterlot by the horde of changelings minions. Magic beams, collapsing walls, house in ruins... The city is burning and she's winning. So close..."

Their prescence is sorely missed and so I did Flutterwonder as an ambient track from collaged bits of the original, some show dialogue, and a slowed microsound of the original track (ie paulstretch).

She's struggling with herself but when she see her friend's harm, she know she must fight. And now in 3:50 she is ready to do it. And then... beware, my little enemies...

(louder harp as it gos on for 2 messures) Fluttershy is calming down but as she looks around she knows anything could happen her fears come back (loud music comes back) she then remembers how her friends would always tell her she is strong and can do anything (the hard music stops it gets soft) its just like the beginning she is happy and nothing can stop her"

I'm betting some of you are getting tired of these, but i really felt like doing something that was heavy, \"epic\" and full of emotion.\r\nTried to implement more metal in this one, because i've been told that the former songs of this type was lacking in the rock/metal departement. (Something i completely agree with)\r\nI'm not sure this time tough; i kinda feel like it's lacking in metal again. But oh well.\r\nAs always,i also wanted it to fit in a video games. It's pretty much a goal i want all of my songs to reach. \r\n\r\nSo, story wise.\r\n\r\nIt's another battle theme, but this time between Twilight and Dash. They don't want to fight, but they have too. \r\nThey both know that the fight will solve everything, no matter who will perish. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty lacking in the story departement, i know. But still, i wanted to create a song that would fit a fight between those two.\r\nA song filled with heavy riffs but also sad emotions. Neither of them wants to fight, and neither of them wants to perish. But they both know\r\nthat one of them won't live to se the sunset.\r\n\r\nBPFF's stands for Best pony friends forever."

Crap, I'm never ready, mind unfurls,\r\nHe's only trying to help I must admit\r\nIntroverion inverts into a mobius strip\r\n\r\nNot yet heard but they smell the nerd\r\nAbsurd, but you know it when they see the witty word\r\nWritten on my shirt, hawaiian attached.\r\nThe comfortable, fashionable Rainbow Crash!\r\n\r\nI could mope, loathe and rage\r\nBut I've learned since there are too many better ways\r\nIf you're going to mock me, it might as well be on stage! \r\nWhere I stand before an audience and s-say:\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\"I am a Closet Brony\r\nCome dance with me and you will learn to see\r\nYou will find what it means to dream\r\nThe life you want to lead on a little glowing screen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a Closet Brony\r\nCome sing with me and we will soon see.\r\nWhat sort of thing could this turn out to be\r\nWhen I put a melody to a blundering scene\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGE\r\n\r\nGotta Find the lesson in this mess\r\nGotta Find a reason so I can rest\r\nGotta Hit the books, pass every test\r\nGotta Make everyone love me like Smarty Pants\r\n\r\nLearn to be kind and learn to be fast\r\nLearn to loosen up and have a blast\r\nLearn to find the harmony in nature\r\nLearn to be at least 20 percent cooler\r\n\r\nStrive to be honest, strive to be free,\r\nStrive to be the only one I know I can be,\r\nStrive to know yourself, and know your friends\r\nStrive to be the one that they can depend\r\n\r\nKnow when to give and when to give more\r\nKnow only you can reflect the dischord\r\nKnow when you're being crazy with your crazy thoughts\r\nKnow that the magic will never, ever stop!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI stand here staring at the mic in my hand,\r\nOccasionally I'll sing but I don't understand.\r\nQuite entirely the power funneling\r\nBut I have the will to be the one controlling\r\n\r\nSo what if I'm a little bit awkward?\r\nI'll improve myself with every step forward!   \r\nTime to make the leap like Daring-Do.\r\nMy weapon the mic will ignite the room!\r\n\r\nSo Princess Celestia,\r\nI'm not really sure what I learned this episode\r\nBut I'll keep being myself, I'll be alright\r\nProblems will rise and fall but I'll still be a-flight\r\n\r\nI've got friends who'll help fight my enemies!\r\nCheesily we agree we can take on anything!\r\nRaise the volume, let's start another day!\r\nGive a pause, a deep breath *gasp* and exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"I am a Closet Brony\r\nCome dance with me and you will finally see\r\nWhat it means to be what you want to be\r\nLive the life you want to lead beyond the glowing screen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a Closet Brony\r\nCome sing with me and we will soon see.\r\nWhat sort of thing can I make this to be\r\nWhen I put a melody to the world before me.\r\n"

You can feel the warm sunrays of Celestia's Sun and shine of Luna's Moon. You can smell the scent of flowers and hear the animals.

However things are not as he imagined, and he quickly discovers himself locked in a never ending nightmare, his only wish to return home from where he came, but was he in Equestria to begin with?\r\n\r\nI end up thinking some interesting stories when making music.\r\n\r\nGenre: ? Probably a mutated baby from the mating of psytrance and industrial."

Went for a progressive / filtered house track. I don't normally operate on such a short time frame but I had a few hours to myself and everything clicked and i released this that Sunday. \r\n\r\nThis is a 2nd version (hence the honeymoon version). Not massive changes but vocals are louder, some extra background music filtered in, and some annoying flaws gone (hopefully). Slightly better end version I think so wanted to get an improvement out. Thanks so much for the positive feedback on the first version!!\r\n\r\nArt by http://gtun3d.deviantart.com/ \r\nThanks!!"

Might save some of them to a new project and flesh it out, who knows.\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks a lot, sci, really like these, keep up the good work.\r\n"

        "description": "A different take on the Solar Empire/Lunar Republic story, that (as far as I know) was never explored. Kinda like inverse Macbeth, I suppose...\r\n\r\nThis was originally going to be an epic orchestral rock song, with Overkillius and Cyril The Wolf, but the project got neglected by all of us for months. I eventually decided to go all Matthew Mosier on it instead (I've got the hair to do it now too :P)\r\n\r\nVideo is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3GLjSH73Hk\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\nSo you thought that you could take over the nation,\r\nBring the beast to its knees, and win our adoration.\r\nTake a good look around at our barren city.\r\nOut of all of the lands, ours is to be pitied.\r\nHad you not been her kin, I would understand it,\r\nBut you could have saved so much by being underhanded.\r\nTake away just one life for the sake of many.\r\nJust like that, you would reign. There was never any need for war.\r\n\r\nMillions of us died because of you\r\nWe battled because you ordered us to.\r\nSo tell me, are you happy now?\r\n\r\nThen on one normal day, just like any other\r\nYou declared civil war, sister against brother.\r\nYou called yourself rightful heir and called for mass retraction.\r\nEither for or against, forcing us to faction.\r\nDaily, I do my best to keep myself from crying\r\nWhen left and right, all I see is everybody dying\r\nEach new face on the ground tells a different story\r\nBe it just to survive, or kill all for the glory or for peace.\r\n\r\nThis is worse than what we had before.\r\nI don't call this place home anymore\r\nI hope that we'll all get through this somehow.\r\nBut tell me, are you happy now?\r\n\r\nIgnorant or evil, I don't know,\r\nBut either way there's nothing left to show\r\nThis battleground was once a happy land,\r\nHarmonious, prosperous, peaceful and grand.\r\nThe leaders play with us like we're a game\r\nAnd though we're different, we all fall the same,\r\nWith nothing left except a simple name\r\nAnd one day I will just be one of them."

        "description": "So last year, I was huge fan of Living Tombstone's 'Been Dreaming' song.  I've ALWAYS wanted to rap over it. VINXIS stepped up and took my challenge.  But I didn't want to tread over the same vocals... SOOOOO Enter: Feather.  This stunning vocalist from Down Under offered her voice and pushed herself vocally to pull off this chorus.  Add into the Mix Vinxis friend: ProcRAdocks, Colortwelve's Advice on working with Vocals, and Ember Dash's morale support & Rainbow Flavored Visualization... \r\n\r\nAnd you have 'Dream'.  It's truly a collaborative effort, and I thank EVERYONE who was part of it.  Just like Mic the Microphone dedicated HIS lyrics to his fans... the same goes for me.  You all make me want to keep writing and recording music! \r\n\r\nTL:DR ~ Thanks to everyone who helped me, and thanks to my core subscribers!  THIS IS FOR YOU! \r\n\r\nLYRICS: \r\n\r\nThink back to a time in the past \r\nwhen you had aspirations and dreams to move fast.\r\n\r\nYou had heroes,and role models and leaders.\r\nAnd you failed several times but never stayed defeated. \r\n\r\nAnd you believed in yourself when others didn't. \r\nBut you cherished in the fact - that you could never fit in.\r\n\r\nAnd you did, what others thought forbidden. \r\nYou stayed on your path while others thought you were kiddin. \r\n\r\nYou didn't think after all those years \r\nYou would drink in success after all those fears. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly you were in it from the beginnin\r\nAnd if anyone was destined to win it, you'd in a minute.\r\n\r\nPut in the effort involved was your bravado.\r\nAnd then showing off your skills in a flash would be your motto. \r\n\r\nBottle it up and add a dash of class. \r\nThen BOOM.  Your burning the competition to ASH. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nFrom the lines of the wide horizon \r\nYou rise from the skies and fly beside the titans.\r\n\r\nMighty and fine, and you blaze with grace.\r\nYou're On pace in this race to the take the 1st place.\r\n\r\nThe main player in the face of neighsayers.\r\nAn ace in the the air, make 'em taste the space layer.\r\n\r\nOr ozone as it's otherwise known. \r\nyou leave 'em gaspin for breath, while you takin the gold home.\r\n\r\nBut don't let the praise go to your head.\r\nUse humility to fuel your abilities instead.\r\n\r\nCause when you're grounded your foundations are built better. \r\nYou can withstand the earthquakes, and ill weather. \r\n\r\nAnd still tethered to the roots of your being. \r\nThe truth is you're only limited to what you can see.\r\n\r\nMeaning the sky's the limit, so you just keep trying. \r\nUse your dreams as the reasons so that you keep flying.\r\n\r\nObligatory Reference Links:\r\nIntro Video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cNkvG2bOcI\r\nLiving Tombstone's Remix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Rawg958Yw\r\nVINXIS: http://www.youtube.com/user/OYKXF\r\nFeather: http://www.youtube.com/user/feather0ponyart\r\n\r\nMP3 Cover Art from: http://explosivegent.deviantart.com/art/Time-Off-Fear-of-Falling-255928759"

Some of the original instrumentation might bleed through a bit, but I did everything I could to remove it or cover it up.\r\n\r\nLikes, favorites and comments are greatly appreciated.

It is based on a story where the mane six finds a treasure map in an old book in the library.\r\nThey decide to go look for it. They hire a boat and a crew and set sails towards the unkown and the treasure.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty fun to do, but was mostly a practice run for me. It is short, around 1:50, but it loops. I wanted it to work in a video game, so that explains that.\r\nIn the video, i've looped it once; that's why the video is around 4 minutes long.\r\n\r\nWorking on two projects at the moment, so expect them to arrive soon.\r\n\r\nLink to the amazing art i used: http://hlissner.deviantart.com/art/Equestria-and-beyond-rev-8-1-253465186?"

I've tinkered around with this for several weeks and the culmination of finalizing it just after bronycon (I couldn't go) is what kind of made me want to combine the concept of the passage of time for the pmv (seasons passing from fall to summer)\r\n\r\nMassive thanks to CopyCat as i did use large chunks of the original and it is his track i remixed after all\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/MixMastaCopyCat\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNqGwv7GoVU"

Waking up from her peaceful airy dreams, she streches her wings and slowly takes off into calm air. Above the cloud line, staring into the thick white sea of clouds, she realizes this will be another great day -- and doing so, she goes into a straight dive through the clouds, flying off towards adventures, leaving only a trail of colors and sunshine behind her.\r\n\r\nFinally continuing from where I was left back in December, after half a year of hard life, college, loss of finances and no time to learn/make music, I managed to make this -- my second track i've ever done , despite all the trouble i had, from FL Studio crashing to losing project files - hence the track turned out bland and repetitive, but oh well, I'm moving on."

        "description": "This was in response to a number of incidents that I saw in the brony community a while back. If we don't actively maintain community, then it will continue to head down the road it's going and fall apart.\r\n\r\nObviously, the lyrics of the singing parts are from Daniel Ingram's \"You Gotta Share\", from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic episode, \"Over a Barrel\".\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\nSo maybe I'm\r\nna\u00efve, or seeing this from a musician's perspective, but\r\nreflective of the fact that we place, at the base, the phrase\r\n\u201cLove and Tolerate\u201d in our fandom, it seems random and unexpected\r\nThat it's being neglected, rejected by the bulk of this\r\ncommunity. You see, I hold strongly to the hope that we can\r\nman up and stand up and walk through conflict head on, instead of\r\ntaking the cheap route and spouting abuse. It's not\r\nhelping you or me or anypony grow.\tThe show\r\nStates that friendship, laughter, loyalty, honesty,\r\ngenerosity, and kindness is the core of sound comradery.\r\nBut looking 'round, it's not the picture I'm seeing. These\r\nThemes should be reflected in our very being.\r\n\r\nYou gotta share. You gotta care. It's the right thing to do.\r\nYou gotta share. You gotta care. There'll always be a way through.\r\n\r\nOr did that become irrelevant or obsolete now? Did somehow a\r\nshow focused on the magic of friendship take a tragic turn\r\nfor the worse and make the opposite arise? The answer lies in the\r\nhearts and the mind of those who view the show. *Pause*\r\nLittle kids know how to get this right. why can't you?\r\nDo you put the morals into practice like you ought to?\r\nOr are the things Fox News say about us really true?\r\nAre we just a bunch of freaks with nothing to do? At what point did \r\nBronydom miss this, and start to diss and evaluate,\r\nmisinterpret, rate, opinionate and excommunicate\r\nThose who made a mistake with no intent to harm?\r\nWas the charm of coloured ponies not enough? Or do we need new\r\ncontent to keep us content? We fight for no reason,\r\nmaybe 'cause we're angsty teens waiting for the next season. Angrily\r\nagreeing in front mirrors and smoke. Something's broke here. Is it\r\nreally wise to choke each other, shame and defame though under the\r\nsurface the same, aside the name, and a change\r\nin melanin? \u201cWe shouldn't argue\u201d, you say. Well, there's a difference between an\r\nargument and a fight; bringing injustices to light and righting a\r\nwrong like some rogue vigilante. Between trying to under-\r\nstand another person's point of view, and insulting your brother, and calling his\r\nmother a dog too. Between disgreeing with a statement a person\r\nmakes and hating them as a person, mate. Conflict is\r\nneccesary, war isn't.\r\n\r\nYou gotta share. You gotta care. It's the right thing to do.\r\nYou gotta share. You gotta care. There'll always be a way through.\r\nYou gotta share. You gotta care. It's the right thing to do.\r\nYou gotta share. You gotta care. There'll always be a way through.\r\n\r\nWe all laughed at \r\nGhost mostly 'cause of his trivial rants\r\nyet with our song and dance, I wouldn't be surprised if someone caught us with our\r\npants down. How would bronies react to that? Some equate us to modern day\r\nFurries and, mate, the line's blurry.\r\nI'm not dissing furries here. I 'aint a hater.\r\nBut in later days, arrogance is rampant in both camps.\r\nAlthough at the start, the heart was so sincere and\r\nsympathetic, empathetic. Now it's just pathetic.\r\nI guess my pivotal point is that you need to place others before\r\nyourself, and shelf aside your own interests to give others the\r\nrespect they need; protect the dejected. help those who the world knows as\r\noutcasts; the least and the last. It's always hard, but the\r\nSeeds of kindness is what frees us from the blindness of the bitter\r\nemptiness, and lets us shine to our full capacity.\r\nAnd if you won't even try new sincerity, get out of this community."

As soon as he's back, I'll take it down from here! \r\n\r\nGreat writing on MC Flowny's behalf. \r\nThis has been in the works for ages, I wanted to do a nice soft and timid Fluttershy song for a while now...\r\nD O W N L O A D :\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/epicmreric/fluttercity-ft-mc-flowny-1\r\nMC F L O W N Y :\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IAmRhymeFlow\r\nF A C E B O O K :\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Epic-Eric/214124938672520\r\n==============================================\r\nLYRICS ~~~~\r\nGotta cautionary tale that you wanna hear. \r\nBout a filly really shy pretty filled with fear. \r\n\r\nPut up in a pretty tough situation. \r\nMade to take trip that caused rough hesitation. \r\n\r\nAnyone could've done it with without much work. \r\nBut then again, ANYONE WASN'T JUST HER. \r\n\r\nTo MUSTER the courage, more-than-enough SIR.\r\nto even THINK to do it, yo she was UNSURE.\r\n\r\nBut then again it's a family affair. \r\nAnd if she - didn't attend, there'd be nobody there. \r\n\r\nSo Long story short, the result wasn't pretty. \r\nImma tell you 'bout Fluttershy in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarted with a letter from a distant relative. \r\nand that this elderly mare, had little to live.\r\n\r\nWith no heirs to care, she had little to give. \r\nBut remembered all the kindness Fluttershy did. \r\n\r\nIn a bid to commend her for all her kind work.\r\nShe invited the filly to stand beside her.\r\n\r\nA MINOR request, at best many kind words.\r\nBut guess what? Fluttershy'd rather DIE FIRST.\r\n\r\nDon't get it twisted, she loved the old mare. \r\nBut at the time she helped, she was just-not-there.\r\n\r\nAnd by there, I mean the big city. \r\nThe noise, and the buildings, & the people moving quickly. \r\n\r\nAnd strictly-speaking, Flutter's a country girl.\r\nIn a way Canterlot is like Disneyworld. \r\n\r\nAnd Not a dizzy world, spinning like Manehattan. \r\nWhere if you play the game wrong, anything can happen. \r\n\r\nAnd happen, things DID to her. \r\nAfter stepping out the Cab, she clipped the curb. \r\n\r\nAnd ran into a vendor, sending his wares tumbling.\r\nToo scared to say she's sorry, she's just mumbling. \r\n\r\nShe got lost, then ac-costed by a Diamond Dog. \r\nWho was -tryna pawn -watch that he lied he 'bought'.\r\n\r\nAnd he GOT 20 bits out of Flutter.\r\nHe thanked her for time, as the watch starts to sputter. \r\n\r\nSo she tried to spread her wings and just fly away.\r\nThen Police said today wasn't flying day. \r\n\r\nShe'd pay a fine if she flew out of order. \r\nBut if she wants, she could take a cab to the border. \r\n\r\nAnd this sordid affair only got worse.\r\nThe gift that she brought she had dropped in her purse.\r\n\r\nShe forgot. So she didn't have it, ~ she was getting frantic\r\nNow emphatically manic, she was having panic attacks.\r\n\r\nDAMN... \r\n\r\nWhat's a girl to do. \r\n\r\nLost in a city you feel's spitting on you.\r\nAnd the truth is - any other Pony would give up now.\r\n\r\nBut beneath Fluttershy is a tough gal.\r\n\r\nSo she cried, then she dried her eyes. \r\nAnd she asked for directions from the nearest guy. \r\n\r\nAnd Rhyme Flow took her straight to the Mare's Front door.\r\nIt's anti-climactic but then why would you want more? \r\n\r\n===========================================\r\nSubmit To Equestria Daily if you think it's worthwhile! ;)"

I am working on mastering it later on.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"

I wanted to jump on a remix of his great track. The original sampled Daniel Ingram's Bronycon webchat which had a load of sound issues and Evan did an amazing job of turning that event into a great track.. Hopefully something like this could be dropped in a set at the next Bronycon afterparty and I went for a big room EBM feel on the remix. No idea why this is only streaming the first 57 seconds, uploaded it twice, it downloads fine."

It took far too long. I started it about a month and a half ago with the intention of making it an original work about Vinyl Scratch. However, it was very hard to find a vocalist that worked and come up with decent lyrics, so it kind of got left alone for a while. Then I put the acapella from Still Shy VIP over it, and it fit so well I decided to turn it into a remix. I wanted to try and get it as perfect as possible... but I eventually decided I may as well upload it and move on to the many other projects I have planned. So here it is! I hope people enjoy it!\r\n\r\n(Also, overall I spent 28 hours working on this according to FL, which is far longer than anything else I have done... O.o)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nExpy/Porcupine"

It might just be my favorite genre of electronic music now, and while this might be a bit more melodic than your average CD, I'm not sure that people have entirely nailed down what Cosmic Downtempo is. I do know that it's supposed to have a lofty space feeling, and what better way to illustrate that than with a song for Luna.\r\n\r\nThis also marks the final pre-release for the UEP album. Now to begin the \"remastering\" process, whatever that means. Look forward to an announcement video on July 14th, and maybe even an ad video before that.\r\n\r\nMare in the Moon vector by \"SpiritofthwWolf\"\r\nhttp://fav.me/d3e9he0\r\n\r\nIf you find you like my work, please comment, rate, like, subscribe, follow, etc.\r\n"

The break itself is about 70% done.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to add a few scenes from The Royal Wedding in the background in which the Changelings are rampaging through the streets and shrieks of agony from ponies, but I'm going to do that later.

While a harsh and sturdy leader, the more time spends with her beloved subjects, the more her heart\r\nopens towards them. If she were in a old RPG, her alignment would be Lawful Evil. I wanted this song to reflect not only herself, but also the feelings her subjects \r\nfeel when they spend time with her. (If that's by her side or in her dungeon is another story.)\r\nTherefore, the song is filled with different emotions and feelings. There's evil parts, more harmonic and melodical etc."

I'm thankful for you guys and so I decided to finally show my appreciation.\r\n\r\nIf you're one of my first followers, you probably recognize this as the 109 subscribers track, but improved greatly. Actually, the drops might not be as extreme as before, but I think the kicks really shine. I originally made an ultimatum of 50 likes for the track, but decided real quickly that that was stupid. Especially since I was enjoying its production.

This track was a blast even if it was running headlong in the wrong direction from everything else we figured that others would be doing (we did sloppy noise rock mixed with punk rock attitude and \u2018gasp\u2019 a sense of humor) or that we\u2019ve both made so far. I\u2019m so glad it was accepted despite being a nice hot fun mess. We stayed up until 3:30 and just made the deadline so well worth the lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nYou can get the whole album (for free even) here http://balloonparty.bandcamp.com/album/after-party\r\nMore info on the recording if you care, lol http://djpon-3.tumblr.com/post/26541677675/thatrainfallguy-aviatorsmusic-finally-the ATR did all the guitars!\r\n"

Hoist the anchor, me lads! \r\nSet sail for Pony Island, for thar's booty to be had! \r\n(PINK CELESTIAS ALL!) Nay, that be not the treasure I seek! \r\nAvast, Fluttershy's Ass! (Yay!) Louder! (YARR!) \r\n\r\nOn our ship, The Poison Joke, we don't take no gruff! \r\n(Christ, we're *pirates!*) Who cares if we watch pony stuff! \r\nWe've loaded up our cannons with confetti and balloons \r\n'cause they're far easier to carry than them Spanish gold dubloons! \r\n\r\n[Well, that be the first verse! Let's sing a rousing pirate chorus! \r\n(Arr!) Are ye ready, me lads? (Arr!)] \r\n\r\nYo ho, yo ho ho (x8)\r\n\r\nHoist the main sail! If I've read my stars correctly \r\nTake a left at Friendship Pass, and we'll find the Ilse directly \r\n(Captain, what about that giant purple beast?) \r\nWhy, that's just Stephen Magnet, jump the ship, give him a feast! \r\n\r\nOn our ship, The Poison Joke, we don't care 'bout gettin' laid. \r\nBut we all trust in the friendship bonds that Twilight helped us made \r\nOur flag is is full of awesome, 'cause it's Rainbow Dashin' round \r\n'n' all the sailors run and hide when they see Toastbeard's come to town! \r\n\r\n[Alright, ye scurvy dogs! Can ye hold yer own without the bassline? (Yarr!)] \r\n\r\nYo ho, yo ho ho (x8)\r\n\r\nWell the Cutie Mark Crusaders \r\njoined and left within a day \r\nAnd the Royal Princess Navy \r\nKnows to stay out of our way \r\nWe respect each buck and colt \r\nEach filly and each mare\r\nWe burn toystores to the ground \r\nIf tha ponies be nay thar! \r\n\r\nYo ho, yo ho ho (x8)\r\n\r\n[Various pirate sounds]"

        "description": "Hip-Hop Remix of the Russian Gypsy Jazz Remix of Pinkie's Brew\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 7/9/12 7pm - WE MADE EQD!!!!\r\nhttp://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/07/music-remix-bubble-berrys-orphanage.html#idc-container\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nPinkie - \r\ngimme a sec to take in all of your words\r\nyou tryna tell me that you want the spin the world in reverse\r\n\r\nand bake a portal to a different time a different dimension\r\nin an attempt to save your parents with a time intervention.?\r\n\r\nHold up. \r\nNow I ain't sayin what you want can be done. \r\nBut then again we got an Alicorn that raises the sun.\r\n\r\nCheck it.\r\nI'll check my recipes to see what we got. \r\nNo harm in messing with the universe, let's give it a shot. \r\n\r\nThis book I have is admanantly saying this is taboo.\r\nThat if we tap into the time-stream that we're the breakin the rules.\r\n\r\nBut hay, it's an experiment, and your reasons good. \r\nTo do a little voodoo magic like a good daughter should. \r\n\r\nNow here's a list, take your time and make sure everything's perfect. \r\nBecause you only get one chance, it'd better be worth it.\r\n\r\nPay attention to the words that I'm about to describe.\r\nCause if you mess up just a little we will probably die.\r\n\r\nWatch as I work my gypsy magic \r\nEye of a newt and cinnamon \r\nWatch as the matter turns to batter\r\nopen the portal, jump in!\r\n\r\nNow, it's says 'caution' - it's probably a guideline.\r\nI don't see a problem with maybe dicing the timeline.\r\n\r\nA fine line between madness and kindness.\r\nIf it was just me, honestly, I wouldn't try this. \r\n\r\nBut it's just advice, you can take it now or leave it.\r\nAnd you could live your life knowing you never succeeded.\r\n\r\nAnd believe me, I can tell in your voice, you really need it.\r\nTo bring your parents back would be an emtpy life, completed.\r\n\r\nDon't ever think I'd ever let a pony leave defeated.\r\nSo once you crack basilisk eggs... make sure to beat it. \r\n\r\nAnd the time dough, please take time to really knead it.\r\nThe lack of folding space equates the wormhole's overheated.\r\n\r\nAnd the LAST THING we need is another event horizon. \r\nBut if you do it right you'll find the cake is slowly rising.\r\n\r\nAnd voila! You've created and baked a time rift.\r\nOr a Magic-based Culinary Paradigm Shift. \r\n\r\nWatch as I weave my voodoo magic\r\nHeart of the bat, and marjoram\r\nWatch as the mixture starts to blister\r\nopen the door to dark lands.\r\n\r\nOnce you go, the portal is up to you.\r\nAnd you can tweak the recipe to change what it'll do. \r\n\r\nBefore I let you leave, would you mind signing the waiver.\r\nI'll need it signed in blood, so put your hoof upon the paper.\r\n\r\nThere is a small chance you'll unlock the great abyss. \r\nBut what the hell, you do it for the parents that you miss.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nMy Little Pony copyright - HASBRO\r\nFriendship Is Magic - Created by Lauren Faust\r\nPinkie's Brew (Original Song) by Griffin Lewis & \r\nJenny Nicholson\r\nSinging by Jenny Nicholson\r\nRussian Gypsy Jazz Remix - by Lenich\r\nHip-Hop Remix of a Remix of a Remix - Colortwelve\r\n\r\nArt Selections by:\r\nhttp://blackgryph0n.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-\r\nPortal-207017468\r\nhttp://youtu.be/o5_fQ7787Es\r\nhttp://www.redbubble.com/people/pixel-pie-\r\npro/works/8215047-caution-pinkie-pie-mlp-fim?\r\np=sticker\r\nhttp://linguma.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-Pie-\r\nPortals-267902298\r\nhttp://www.andysowards.com/blog/assets/CTHULHU\r\n_by_reau.jpg\r\nhttp://2snacks.deviantart.com/art/There-was-no-\r\ntalking-there-was-no-smiling-282664644"

Becoming Rockular, maybe?\r\n\r\nI never actually thought I would do a version of this song, since when I heard it on the show I forgot about it pretty quickly. Then as I was going through the various songs in search of something to cover and I listened to this song I pretty quickly got an idea about how I could arrange it and all the pieces came together pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nAs always, likes, faves, comments and subrscribes are greatly appreciated."

Enjoy.\r\n\r\n1)Grand Nocturne\r\nIntended to be some kind of \"Vinyl meets Luna\" track. I felt really good about it, but I got massive musician's block and just decided to scrap the project. I have the file saved, so I might pick it up again some time though.\r\n\r\n2)Tune Of The Moon (Luna's Theme)\r\nSelf-explanitory. A theme for everyone's favorite ruler of the night.\r\n\r\n3)Colors Blur (Theme Of The Running Of The Leaves)\r\nI loved the Running Of The Leaves portion of Fall Weather Friends, and I wanted to make a song for it. Again, I got stuck, and I felt that it really wasn't all that great. That midbass freaking sucks.\r\n\r\n4)Chill Quick\r\nJust a simple little Drum n' Bass loop. Probably something Vinyl would listen to while brushing her teeth or something.\r\n\r\n5)Prepare To Be Taught! (Cheerilee's Theme)\r\nHeavily inspired by early 90's house music.\r\n\r\n6)In The Vapor\r\nNot much to say about this one. Mane 6's first journey into space?\r\n\r\n7)Chilled Juice\r\nMoonlight beach party! Well, that's what it makes me think of."

The end isn't near.\r\nI serve as a messenger, but heed this if you must\r\nIt's only if you're unaware that it will come to pass.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\nWe will strive onward\r\nand we will persevere\r\nfor we bear the true meanings of\r\nlove and tolerance\r\nand if we ever decide to go our separate ways\r\nwe'll look back at this time and then we'll smile.\r\n\r\n(Bridge)\r\nThere was a time when we agreed.\r\nThere was a time when we could stand eachother.\r\nAn everlasting friendship, forged by ourselves,\r\nbringing hope and vision to a darkened world.\r\nBut we found a way to fight ourselves.\r\nBut we found a way to fight everyone.\r\nA brief endearing moment, forgotten,\r\nlike a summer's breeze, blowing by.\r\nYou thought it was the fault of the cloppers.\r\nYou thought it was the fault of the furries.\r\nYou thought it was the fault of everyone else,\r\nbut did you stop and think that it was the fault of ourselves?\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nInspiration for the song?\r\n\r\nFirst off, this song isn't to make anybody frustrated or angry.  I won't lie, there's been some issues with the community, but nothing out of the ordinary, and that's the problem right there.  People like to blame others for whatever situation happens that they don't expect and/or they don't like.  This song was meant to have an uplifting message.  One that basically states how we may have our issues, but as long as we don't blame others for those issues, we can always move on with the community.\r\n\r\nOMG talk about a serious buzz kill type song.  Ah well, that's what I do best.\r\n\r\nGenre: Electronic/Industrial"

An hour to arrange and many days to practice and it's still not perfect...let's just say it's \"charmingly rustic\"?\r\n\r\nSo, pour yourself a glass of merlot (if you drink, I don't, so it's root beer for me), grab a nice lamb or beef shank (or if you're vegematarian, a hearty stew), sit with your special somepony down by the fire in your cabin in the woods (of course) and let the correct notes take you away. And nevermind the messy ones. ;P\r\n\r\nHere's the sheet music for it: http://www.mediafire.com/view/?dcrvl1apij1vuu1\r\n\r\nI saw this image and just had to put it with this song. It helps the warm fuzzies multiply. Artist is: http://rizcifra.deviantart.com/ and I'm really liking the emotion he puts in his works.\r\n\r\nRemember kids: Daniel Ingram wrote this piece and all copyright resides with him, his publishing company, Hasbro, or something like that.

Pair that with Gun's demented beat... and you have \"Diane's Cupcakes\".  \r\n\r\nI imagine Zecora sitting around a fireplace telling foals the legend of the Pink Haired Serial Killer and the demonic presence that coaxes her to do it.

The Pinkie type cousin. \r\nWith genetically a gift to bake inside ovens. \r\n\r\nbut Besides making pies - creating a bakers dozen.\r\nShe's a shy filly type who tries to say nuthin. \r\n\r\nNow.\r\n\r\nGot some foals of her own to raise right.\r\nShe's a role model while rollin cinnamon rolls tight. \r\n\r\nAnd her sole plight is to bank bits the whole time. \r\nCause her business that she runs is considered her gold mine. \r\n\r\nWhile she holds the line she still finds time to hike.\r\nCause the trails in Fillydelphia's under a bright sky.\r\n\r\nAnd it's like she's the type whose shop could take flight.\r\nTake a sec and say hello to Ms. Oatmeal Pie. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZADIsm6AXg&feature=BFa&list=HL1340583207\r\nhttp://capt-nemo.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-Loves-Muffins-215964768\r\nhttp://2snacks.deviantart.com/art/There-was-no-talking-there-was-no-smiling-2...\r\nhttp://dahli-lama.deviantart.com/art/081411-MLP-FIM-Cupcakes-252923302\r\nhttp://rycz.deviantart.com/art/It-s-Always-Sunny-in-Fillydelphia-273779260\r\nhttp://russelh.deviantart.com/art/Around-Ponyville-199546468\r\n\r\nDa_Lesler's DA Page: http://emorocker4.deviantart.com/"

I changed quite a bit overall from the great original track but kept a lot too. Found a nice happy place between alt rock, industrial, dubstep, and hip hop. Like the original it's in a grimdark vein and is a long track so i'll likely also put together a \"radio edit\" version when i have it ready for ytube in a few days. Thanks to my pals who've listened on the wips and helped shape this into completion and for getting the stems to remix this. "

I love the idea of taking orchestral music and infusing it in dance music so glad to do that for this great track and focus on 2 background ponies working so well together."

        "description": "8 Bars over Love Is In Bloom\r\n\r\nThis is my short but sweet nod to a very infectious pop track that surprised me when I watched the Season 2 Finale.  Pinkie pulling Pon3 from wherever and suddenly Twilight proving why Unicorns were genetically gifted to perform.\r\n\r\nI loved this song!  I loved it even more that an extended version came out, and I always wanted to put a short 8-bar verse on there.  It seemed appropriate.  Anyway, to keep it consistent I kept the first part of the video, and after my verse, I wanted the rest of the song to play with pictures that would be continuation of the photos from the first part.  It's fast... and it's short.  But I promise the next release is a full fledged song.\r\n\r\nLyrics: \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning I could tell. \r\nOur story together whatever way would end well. \r\nAnd well, here we are on the verge of matrimony.\r\nI'd be the groom and you would be my little pony.\r\nOnly in this case you would be my light.\r\nYou would be my life. \r\nAnd in every sense of the word you would be my wife.\r\nAnd it's right, when we first met. \r\nYou planted the seed. \r\nAnd it's bloomed to a love that I NEED. Please.\r\n\r\nCredits: \r\nHasbro for MLP\r\nHub for FIM \r\nDaniel Ingram for the song\r\nRebecca Shiochet for singing it\r\n"

This time, i used real drums tough.\r\nBackstory is quite simple. \r\nThe song's story and music is based on an idea i had for a MLP platforming game. Created this for a level where the Mane6 would have to travel back to the mines/caves\r\nthe Diamond Dogs lived in. What would they find? What sort of adventure, and beauty, waited for them ahead?\r\n\r\nTried to make it both adventures and sort of emotional, both to make it fit with the level i had in mind, but also to fit Rarity's personality. \"A Dog and pony show\" focused on Rarity, \r\nand thus i also tried to make the song similar to her personality. While she is very calm, caring and loving, she also enjoys adventures and would never\r\nstep down to help her friends. \r\n"

I couldn\u2019t make anything - wallpaper, photos, music\u2026 Absolutely nothing. Just random surfing through the networks. Also yesterday I didn\u2019t have access through the whole day but at least I received I-DE-AS! Finally!\r\n\r\nWhat can I say about this track\u2026 Originally I made it few days ago and it was kinda ready to send to YT. But when I rode it in Audiosurf I realised it was so\u2026 boring! Really. Seven minutes long trance lullaby. Then the art crash came\u2026 and finally - yesterday. I reorganized the track, corrected the pads and suddenly I had Moonstuck\u2019s Woona crossing around my mind. So I thought: \u201cinstrumental Moonstuck track isn\u2019t a bad idea\u201d and I made it.\r\n\r\nWhy Moonstuck? Dunno, really. Maybe because that pads in the break reminds me that pic I used as a cover - Woona sitting on the Moon and stargazing. Also I like that series :) So if you somehow doesn\u2019t know it, visit Moonstuck\u2019s tumblr (link below).\r\n\r\nAnd one last thing: I didn\u2019t put that cut version of track without a reason. It\u2019s kinda experiment, you know. I wanted to give you an essence of this track, without the intro and outro. The original mix you\u2019ll find in Download section.\r\n\r\nGENRE: Electronic || STYLE: Trance\r\nBPM: 136\r\n_____\r\n\r\nBandcamp wav: http://nicolasdominique.bandcamp.com/track/moonstuck (1$)\r\n\r\nART\r\nCover (by EnnervateIndustries): http://fav.me/d53muu4\r\nMoonstuck: http://woonastuck.tumblr.com\r\nhttp://egophiliac.deviantart.com/\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nVISIT MY OTHER PAGES:\r\nDeviantART: http://niklasshepherd.deviantart.com/\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nicolas-Dominique/127278100744857\r\nSoundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/nicolas-dominique\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/99plusmusic"

From now on, Navy Brony will be used for PIRL videos, parodies, etc.  I will still be uploading songs on this account, but they will be under the name of Navron.\r\n\r\nA little background on the song (considering there's no lyrical content):\r\n\r\nStory is about an obsessive brony who, through using Astral Projection, attempts to visit Equestria.  He succeeds, but the Equestria of his mind is not the Equestria he envisioned, and is soon trapped in a nightmare in which there is no way out.\r\n\r\nGenre: Trance/Dubstep"

They all\r\nPushed you down, kicked you on the ground, and left you battered and bruised.\r\nNone of what you own or known or could've shown could stop the\r\nArrogance and pride inside your heart, so they collectively used\r\nEvery part of you that they could lay a hand on\r\nJust to rise and stand upon the giant they refuse to name.\r\nNow you got nothing, no one, nowhere to run, your time\r\nHas come, but keep in mind you used to be exactly the same.\r\n\r\nVerse 2\r\nI see you wanna be a man, and plan your way back to the top\r\nagain to regain what you think is meaning incarnate\r\nBut today, let me show you about a way, completely\r\nCounter-culture to the way in which you used to operate\r\nRealise, open up your eyes, and see a day\r\nwhere everybody puts each other first because they choose to\r\nlive that way. They have travelled through the pain and learned\r\nthat one another matters more than any system in the world.\r\n\r\nChorus\r\nI see you're wondering what friendship could be,\r\nBut can't you see: true love will set you free.\r\nNot the shallow love you know from the shadows of your throne,\r\nbut one that sets aside self to make a space for harmony"

In Greek mythology, Acheron is one of the tributaries to the river Styx in the underworld.\r\n\r\nI imagine them just floating downriver with no return. Just chilling. The dead are whispering. Death is beautiful, yet creepy. Or you can imagine the whispering choir as \"life\" entering the realm of death. \r\n\r\nI imagine the Timberwolves are not chasing our protagonists, but instead they are running away from the ice (notice how one freezes in the left). These are just my opinions and in no way should reflect on your interpretation to Ziom's amazing artwork. \r\n\r\nPart 5 will be out soon. "

I really need to work on mixing too before I even consider slamming the limiter on a track.\r\n\r\nAt one point I thought the track would end up being about Wendigos, because I think it has a sort of icy feel to it. But I really wanted to use that spike clip, and realized that the song could sort of work with the idea of Spike becoming a monster that he is ashamed of being seen as.\r\n\r\nEh, could have come up with something better I'm sure, amongst other things. But I'm pretty happy with this overall, so I hope you are too. Still taking critique as always.\r\n\r\nIf you find you like my work, please comment, rate, like, subscribe, follow, etc.\r\n\r\n--\r\nStock Credits:\r\nSpike Sleeping vector by scrimpeh found here: http://fav.me/d4sdz3s\r\nBehind the Fence by CAStock found here: http://fav.me/d4bsop7\r\n"

And i thought \"Let's remake my first song, Fluttershy's Goodbye!\" \r\nI was actually going to wait with it, and do it when i reached 600 or 700 subscribers, but my good friend Senjan told me to go for it, so i did! His channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/Senjan Check him out, he is awesome.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who haven't heard the original, here is a link to it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnvYRJwJA-Q\r\nHere is also the idea behind the original and the remake :\r\nWhen composing this song, i had a scenario in my head, where Fluttershy (for some reason) had to permanently move away from Ponyville.\r\nThis song would play when she and her friends had their last get together, where they all talked about memories and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nI tried to make sure this version were pretty much like the original, and therefor i didn't really add to a whole lot of new things.\r\nI kept it simple, melodic and emotional. Basically, i wanted fans of the original to also like this one, just as much or more.\r\n \r\nThanks for sticking with me guys. I really appreciate all the feedback and praise you've given me. Let's aim for 1000 subscribers!\r\n"

Photo Finish, Sapphire Shores, Hoity Toity and Prince Blueblood, all well known celebrities, briefly feature in the music sequence as well.\""

While I had no particular problems with drums and bass, arranging the guitars was tougher. I tried to stay true to the original arrangement, but I wasn't always sure how well a classical arrangement would translate to electric guitar. I'm still not 100% sure about some bits, but a finally came to a point where I didn't see anything else I could do, and so I decided to release it.\r\n\r\nAs always, faves and comments are greatly appreciated."

Hope to see you there!\r\n\r\n\"The Smile Song[2] is a song featured in the episode A Friend in Deed. It is sung by Pinkie Pie expressing her love of laughter, happiness, and friends when making her way around Ponyville with a great big smile. In the sequence Pinkie can be seen greeting several ponies, cheering up sad fillies and helping Applejack paint her barn. By the end of the song a large crowd of smiling background ponies and the leading characters have gathered around Pinkie Pie. They all sing along for the finale of the song after which Pinkie Pie meets Cranky Doodle Donkey for the first time. The song was uploaded to YouTube by user \"Veronica Dela Cruz\" on 7 November 2011 but removed soon after; the leak led to Hasbro \"cracking down\" on material released by the show's artists.[3]\"\r\nMidi by supermatt314\r\n\r\nEnd credit audio from YTP: Pinkie Pie Spikes Her Own Punch by comickrew\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qThrtJq4HUw"

I have gotten back into the swing of things recently, so hopefully you'll be getting some more music from me soon. This summer hasn't been a total bust, however, since I've managed to at least get a collaboration done with a fellow brony musician. He's a rapper and singer on Youtube who goes under the name 'I'dLike2beaTree' and he's also a pretty friendly guy. Go check out his Youtube here if you want to hear more of his stuff: http://www.youtube.com/user/IdLike2BeATree\r\n\r\nAnyway, as for the song itself, this is a song about Queen Chrysalis' hatred towards Princess Celestia in the finale of Season 2 of MLP: FiM. It's a rather dark affair but it's still least melodic. I actually think it's the most melodic hip hop beat I've yet produced. \r\nSamples taken from: \r\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - A Canterlot Wedding, part 2 (sounds) \r\nThe Incredible Bongo Band - Apache \r\nMother Lode - Soft Shell \r\nMiles Davis - So What \r\nBrian Eno - 1/2 \r\nClaude Debussy - Claire de Lune \r\nMahler - Symphony 5, movement 4\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nVERSE 1:\r\n\r\nYou think you can own all of our land \r\nBlaspheme to your people and think we wont stand \r\nup for what we believe in, to recognize \r\nthe nationalistic sin- think we won't devise \r\nA way to bring down your authoritative rule \r\nprove that we aren't just barbaric fools \r\na people, when united can still fight \r\nwe can and will come together to unite \r\nOne day, somehow, i will take back what's mine \r\nSomehow convince your people, how to redefine \r\nwhat life is, what it means. \r\nWhat love is, why it's just so obscene \r\nmaybe then they can finally see through that screen \r\nthat you built, in the hopes that no one would see \r\nIm the only one who can bring us salvation \r\nSomehow avoid my people's death by starvation \r\nSo i will, i will remake and rebuild \r\nonly after all your people have been killed \r\nand thus my own will rise to the top \r\nnever to stop, never to drop \r\nLiving only as the best of the best \r\nsomething to which you cannot attest \r\nI will grow stronger and live longer \r\nsomething that i cannot say for you\r\n\r\nChorus: \r\nI will bring you down to my level \r\nonly then will the people revel \r\nand they'll finally see what you did wrong \r\nOnce again, our people will be strong\r\n\r\nVERSE 2:\r\n\r\nImagine a world with no autocracy \r\nlet me introduce a new theocracy \r\nwave bye bye to this old hypocrisy \r\nAs i instill my new bureaucracy \r\nthe time has come for Celestia's Judgement \r\nLet her finally feel our own torment \r\nAs her people, and her empire, buckle and fall \r\nOur (ultimate) victory, none can forestall \r\nNo longer will we waste away in the dark \r\nThis is our final journey, and its time to embark\r\n\r\nCHORUS x2\r\n\r\nVERSE 3:\r\n\r\nYou're discovery was a bit too late \r\nfinally you'll feel our thousand year hate \r\nYour defenses are failing, it's time to resign \r\nDown with your monuments, up with my shrine! \r\nA final battle, one that you cannot win \r\nNow the greatest feast of our lives will begin \r\nBOw to the supreme ruler of your people \r\nNothing can attest to this, 1000 foot steeple \r\nI have won, listen to the sound of the drums \r\nit's all over, even love cant overcome!\r\n\r\nNo! This can't happen, won't! I wont let it \r\nLosing is one thing that i cannot permit."

I sort of wanted to song to have different personalites aswell,\r\nwhich is why it changes from upbeat and heavy parts to more hopefull and calm parts. Whenever i imagine a battle song, i not only\r\nimagine it as being heavy and pumping, but also hopefull and melodical, i don't know about you."

That wave may be a little too... big, but remember - that's my first video there.\r\nAnd about the remix... I loved the since I heard the demo. Then was quite nice and with vocals became even better. I must admit, I'm not a fan of Mic's tunes but in Tei's track he made a great work. \r\nFirst I was trying to make remix in my style, trance, but I can't make good vibes. Then I decided to make something different - something more electronic and breaks. So I did that. Funny thing I was asking Tei about his pads from Sins and... I didn't use them after all. \r\nSo enjoy if that's possible!\r\n_____\r\n\r\nStory of that track (by Tei):\r\nThe story is basically that Princess Celestia, trough the mids of time always had these hench men to do her evil deeds just to make sure that no one played in the night, which eventually led to Princess Luna's jealousy and demise.\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\n\r\n(Verse1)\r\nShrouded beneath the lucid, moonlit sky\r\nVeiled in darkness; Hiding from your sight\r\nThese messengers; waiting and roaming the streets\r\nKeeping an eye out and making sure you sleep.\r\nTheir silohuette's eclipsing the light as they stride\r\nWith eyes fixed upon them from those still inside\r\nYes these are the ones, with their hearts clad in fire,\r\nThat are known to us all as The Sins of the Solar Empire\r\n\r\n(Verse2)\r\nUnder the orders from the the Princess of the Sun.\r\nIf they find you awake, you'll have nowhere to run.\r\nIf slumber elsudes you, then you'd better pray.\r\nTo be lucky enough to see the light of day.\r\nThe howls and screams of those caught within the night.\r\nA reminder to those who wish to stand and fight.\r\nYour future looks bleak; the consequences are dire.\r\nFor none can stand against The Sins of the Solar Empire."

I guess what inspired me was that she can be more courageous and assertive (hint hint) than any other pony although being so timid.\r\n\r\nThe brony community has to be one of the best communities in the world. The sheer amount of great songs and talented musicians is inspiring. That's why i tried to write a song myself (and now it's intimidating as well as inspiring). I don't think it's particularly good though. Oh, well.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nArtwork by Jewelweed-Shine (http://jewelweed-shine.deviantart.com/)"

        "description": "A song I made about Rainbow Dash. This song is based on the idea of Rainbow Dash flying over Equestria and looking at it from a perspective that most don't get to see, from the sky. Mostly about how beautiful it would look from above. \r\n\r\nWill be on my EP alongside \"Pinkie Says Dance\", \"Why So Shy\", and \"Queen Chrysalis Takes Over Equestria\" The EP will be based on each of the main 6 and some background characters. No official release date though being it may take me awhile to make because of school and other stuff. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nOriginal Art used for cover: http://poninnahka.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-flying-293679851"

Thank you Lauren for your  brilliant ideas, and thank you Hasbro for letting Lauren do what she wanted with the show (For the most part.)   and making something everyone could watch, not just children \r\n\r\nThank you Lauren Faust. I thank you very much for making such a great show that doesn't make me cringe from the horrible writing/voice acting.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to thank Daniel Ingram for making such amazing music for the show! you're a very talented guy, and I wish you good luck in your future endeavors if you decide to leave MLP:FiM anytime in the future. :D\r\n\r\nSorry this description is so long, but I had a LOT to say.

I bring the sickle down.\r\n\r\nI BRING THE SICKLE DOWN. Take all of you underground\r\n\r\nBuffaloBrony\r\nThen why would you care, thinking 'bout this blue mare,\r\nWhen you're too afraid to look into my stare!?\r\nThough, I'm here, you dare to show your fear!?\r\nI've been on the moon for a f-cking thousand years!\r\n\r\nAnd for a thousand years, I've been the only one,\r\nI've been the only one, who's never had a friend...\r\n\r\nLike the rest of them, you should try your best to escape;\r\nThere's an emergency exit otherwise know as death!\r\n\r\nBut here's my testament resting up in a stone tomb,\r\nIt's not a crime keeping friends in a store room!\r\n\r\nUnderneath the floor, lies hidden catacombs,\r\nIt's a prison like a labyrinth for those who roam\r\nWithin it, they're hidden, and hoping that they could be home,\r\nBut let me tell you now you're under my throne!\r\n\r\nAnd it's a nice home, it's got books and warm fire,\r\nI even got you all beds so you can sleep tonight :D\r\n\r\nSo get used to it! This is your life now,\r\nNever see the bright sky... Don't gripe, down\r\n\r\nHere it's always nighttime, ephemeral darkness,\r\nUnder Nightmare Moon's Dark Empire..."

This is the first song in a series of three:\r\n\r\n1. Sisters             (Published) http://eqbeats.org/track/474\r\n2. The Nightmare War   (Published) http://eqbeats.org/track/1907\r\n3. One Thousand Years  (Published) http://eqbeats.org/track/473\r\n\r\nThis song features two parts; Celestias part, which is played on the \"celesta\", and Lunas part which is played on a synth \"vox\" (Synth voice). The two instruments are very much the same, as were Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. Though both are very distinguishable when played together they could easily be mistaken for each other when played separately. Once again echoing the two princesses."

We need that more than you think.\r\nSee, we can\u2019t live without the Cakes and Pinkie.\r\nWe\u2019ll, we can\u2026 but things\u2019d just be very boring.\r\n\u2026Moving on.\r\n\r\nIt seems the duo can do naught to fraught\r\n the stranger bringing danger to ponies everywhere\r\nThe bear edges closer, with a menacing growl\r\nWe really could use a Deus ex Machina right now.\r\n\r\nAn\u2019 then Luna rocks up, an\u2019 she kicks up a storm.

They have travelled through the pain and learned\r\nthat one another matters more than any system in the world.\r\n\r\nChorus\r\nI see you're wondering what friendship could be,\r\nBut can't you see: true love will set you free.\r\nNot the shallow love you know from the shadows of your throne,\r\nbut one that sets aside self to make a space for harmony"

I really don't.\r\nIt's just you're way more than I can handle.\r\nHow can I show you, you can make it easier on me\r\nPlease stop messin' with my head.\r\n\r\n[u]Verse 2[/u]\r\nI always turn to you when I need laughter\r\nYou help me through the bad times and good\r\nBut this time, I need saving from disaster\r\nAnd it seems that you have me misunderstood\r\nYou always take the tangents over yonder\r\nYet you always seem to know whats going on\r\nHow you end up being right. I wonder\r\nBut that's something that I'm now dependant upon\r\n\r\nPre-Chorus, then Chorus x2\r\n\r\n[u]Verse 3[/u]\r\nAt times your motives seem like a delusion\r\nI'm not sure if you mean to be askew\r\nBut over time, I've come to this conclusion:\r\nyou're out of place but that's why i need you\r\nSure, you're really wild and too much for me\r\nbut theres more to you than what's on the outside\r\nYou're a caring, friendly pony, Pinkie\r\nAnd there's no reason why those aspects should hide\r\n\r\nChorus x3"

This, according to the FLStudio project, took 7 hours and 46 mins to finish, although I started last Monday and finished about Saturday but didn't upload it to EQB until just now. =P I decided to do happy hardcore since this song is so gosh darn cute/happy anyway so it seemed appropriate. In any case, let me know how this one turned out. I will be doing more remixes in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see my 10 min video edit of it, here ya go:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB8H-JqAJHE"

Turns out Pon-3 was hired for a gig out there so Octavia and I took a journey by carriage. Have vinyl will travel.

I'm a huge fan of Makkon and his original so doing an electronic / dance remix for something that was completely orchestral seemed like a fun twist (I did use a small bit of his original during the breakdown). You can't go back any earlier in MLP then the first minute of Season 1 Ep1 and Celestia, Nightmare Moon, and Equestria's origin story. The idea of two warring sisters who control day and night and having to banish your own sister is pretty epic so I hope this captures some of this.Wanted the pmv to be as big as the track, hope you like!\r\n\r\nThanks again so much to Makkon for the chance to remix this and the midi\r\nHis original is here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PLs7QuwzRc\r\n\r\nArtwork by (thx for permission from all)\r\nKevin Bolk http://kevinbolk.deviantart.com/gallery/31705695"

Two \"the end is near\" postings (one on MLR and another on Pony Confessions and listening to Tarby's \"We Are the End\" which is so powerful an instrumental that it seemed to channel these posts into \"lyrics\" (just spoken from their posts, i can't sing). It's not meant to preachy but I think a track that makes you think about what the community was capable of losing (ie imploding) is a good thing. I was nervous on how comments about the strife within the Brony community would be received by an \"outsider\" but the reception to this was better than I could have forseen (tied for 2nd on Toastbeard for that week and my most positive reception as a musician ever at that point).

I'm also starting classes soon, so I might not have as much time to make music. Don't fret though, I have a few tracks on the way, including a few potential collabs :D\r\n\r\nAnyway, I made this remix for Remix War V (as you can tell from the title). I've always been a fan of Still Shy VIP, and I figured I'd try to make a UK Hardcore remix of it. I spent a lot of time getting the mixdown right for some reason on this song, so hopefuly it sounds alright."

Normally when I want to remix a song, I work around the acapella, but instead I decided to make the song first (well part of it), then have the acapella work around it. I must say, this worked out a thousand times better, less stress, and finished faster. Although I missed the good ol times of finding out what to do.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you guys like this. This is so far my favorite remix that I've done so far and I'm starting to better familiarize myself with Fruity Loops Studio. Hope you enjoy this.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks to generalzoi for the pony maker. Probably should've made my cutie mark a music note or general dj gear cause I'm not exactly a turntablist but meh, I'll go with it. Rest is just 2 hours of photoshop magic.\r\n\r\nFinished an AMV of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk3Km9viDsg"

Well, that and a white pony with a wild cerulean mane and eyes of mystery hidden behind purple shades. A pony who came from a very different world than her and lived to a very different kind of tune. Her greatest friend and ally. Now, left with only bitter sweet memories in her heart, Octavia retreats from the spotlight back to a warm secluded cottage in the rustic Ponyville she once shared with that somepony special to find piece of mind and to put down all the heavy memories and whirling emotions locked away deep inside of her in one last secret project. . .\r\n\r\nToday, we bring you one of Octavia's finest and most coveted, for it's rarity, compositions.

It might take some time before i upload my next pony song,\r\nbut we'll see. Not sure how much free time i will have in the near future.\r\n\r\nAanyways, on to the song! This one is pretty reminiscent of one of my older songs, called Pinkie Responsibility Pie. It's inspired by Pinkie Pie, and \r\nher positive and joyfull style. Therefore, i tried to make it happy, but also emotional. It was pretty fun one to compose.\r\n\r\nAs always, many thanks to my friend Senjan (https://www.youtube.com/user/Senjan) for giving me feedback on this song."

This time, I pause on my original track I was doing to sketch this down before I end up forgetting this. You know on some classic breaks albums, tracks would have a fairly long intro that features someone talking about some serious stuff and the track slowly enters in? Yeah, I've been wanting to try this for a while but only up till now did I finally get to actually doing it.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the episode and theme song which are under the same name. In any case, I hope you all enjoy this. Heh, this all together took about 8 1/2 hours to finish."

        "description": "\"Royal Canterlot Voice\"\r\nOriginal Song by 0neTr1ckP0ny\r\n\r\nWell, it's finally done; my first pony original. It actually all went a lot smoother than I anticipated. I wasn't even planning on doing an original song, but then I saw a picture of Luna using her Royal Canterlot Voice, the idea for the main riff popped in my head, and everything else fell into place fairly quickly. If only songwriting could always be this easy.\r\n\r\nI already have a new song mostly written, but I expect it to be more complicated to record than this one. I guess I'll see once I get going, so no promises as to when it will be ready.\r\n\r\nAs always (or maybe now even more since it's my own song) likes, favorites, comments and subs are greatly appreciated. And share it with whomever you think might like this song.\r\n\r\nTo quote David Lee Roth: \"If you like it, tell a friend. If you hate it, tell an enemy.\" \r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- The guitars are in drop C. I probably need heavier strings... \r\n- The vocals are what they are; I'm not much of a singer.\r\n- The electronic bits were done by trial and error; I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to electronic music. Maybe somebody someday will make those parts better. \r\n- The lyrics (if you can call them that) speak of Luna's feelings of alienation after coming back from a thousand years spent on the moon (pre \"Luna Eclipsed\").\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\nI've been away for so long everything I used to know has changed\r\nI don't recognize this place, I'm the only one who's still the same\r\n\r\nI try not to be bitter\r\nI try to be strong\r\nI try to make my voice heard\r\nBut it always comes out wrong\r\n\r\nI scream but nopony hears me\r\nI'm drowned out by the noise\r\nI call but nopony answers\r\nWith my Royal Canterlot Voice\r\n\r\nI hardly go outside but when I do the ponies talk behind my back\r\nThe nighttime is so lonely that sometimes I feel about to crack\r\n\r\nI try not to be angry\r\nI try to belong\r\nI try to make myself heard\r\nBut it always comes out wrong\r\n\r\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."

So i ended up going through my acapellas and then BAM! it hit me. YAC (Yelling at Cats) would sound awesome over this instrumental. So mixing in his verses and a snip bit from the original becoming popular i made this mix. Hope you enjoy.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.\r\n\r\nWhat started as a fun way to spend  a few hours recording music has blossomed into a nice little channel. 278 subscribers and going on 27,000 views. I can only say one thing: Wow! And thank you, you guys are the best. Oh, and \"Yay\" of course.\r\n\r\nAs for the song, after uploading the rock version of \"Find A Pet Song\" I listened to it and thought, \"Wait a second: the song has the perfect rhythm and arrangement for a ska tune!\" So I took the Bigger and Cooler Rock version, made the rhythm guitars a bit more ska-like, removed most of the lead guitars and replaced them with brass.\r\n\r\nNow I'd like to mention a couple of things:\r\n\r\n1. Although I listen to some ska punk, I'm in no way an expert and have never played in a ska band; this might be stylistically way off.\r\n2. I did not check YouTube to see if anybody else has made a ska version of this song. If somebody has, they did it first.\r\n3. Everything I know about ska I learned from Ska-P and Less Than Jake.  So if this song is terrible, it's entirely their fault! :-)\r\n4. This is my first time arranging brass; I have no real experience with the instruments so I went entirely by ear. I tried to look up the ranges of the various components but didn't find a definitive answer. So any mistakes are entirely mine.\r\n\r\nWow, did you really read all that??? :-)"

As always, I can't thank all of you enough. I hope you get a laugh out of this song.\r\n\r\nThis is a parody of the They Might Be Giants song \"Kiss Me, Son of God\". I was listening to it a few days ago and thought it really reminded me of Celestia... :-) So I did a quick punked-up ponified version of it. It's pretty rough around the edges, I did everything in a few takes and didn't have too much time to spend on polishing it. I also used a bit of the \"studio magicks\" to try and mask my mistakes, of which there are plenty.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis song in no way implies that an autocratic hereditary monarchy isn't the very best form of government and that the tyra... I mean, our dear ruler should be toppled and replaced with a more representative one. Nor does it in any way endorse the New Lunar Republic.\r\n\r\nPower to the ponies!\r\nThe revolution will be televised. In season 8.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nI built a little empire\r\nOut of some crazy garbage\r\nThey call the blood of the exploited working class\r\nBut they've overcome their shyness\r\nNow they're calling me \"Your Highness\"\r\nAnd the world screams: \"Kiss me, Celestia\"\r\n\r\nI destroyed the bond of friendship and respect\r\nBetween the only ponies left\r\nWho even looked me in the eye\r\nNow I laugh and make a fortune\r\nOff the same ones that I tortured\r\nAnd the world screams: \"Kiss me, Celestia\"\r\n\r\nI look like Luna, so they say\r\nBut dear Miss Luna is very far away\r\nNow you're the only one here\r\nWho can tell me if it's true\r\nThat you love me\r\nAnd I love me\r\n\r\nI built a little empire\r\nOut of some crazy garbage\r\nThey call the blood of the exploited earth ponies\r\nBut they've overcome their shyness\r\nNow they're calling me \"Your Highness\"\r\nAnd the world screams: \"Kiss me, Celestia\"\r\nYes, the world screams: \"Kiss me, Celestia\""

        "description": "\"Yay!\"\r\nOriginal Song by 0neTr1ckP0ny\r\n\r\nWow, I wasn't sure if this song would ever see the light of day. I had the basic idea for it back when I was still working on \"Royal Canterlot Voice\". I had the written all the melodies and the lyrics for a verse, the chorus and the bridge. But I didn't know if I could actually make the song work, because I didn't know if I could get the arrangement right and if I could make the Yays sound big enough. But after some test recordings I was more confident that I could put everything together.\r\n\r\nInitially I was going to seek help for the lyrics, since I'm not much of a lyricist, but then I ended up finishing them myself, because I wanted to get the vocals down.\r\n\r\nAs always likes, favorites, comments and subs are greatly appreciated. And share it with whomever you think might like this song.\r\n\r\nTo (again) quote David Lee Roth: \"If you like it, tell a friend. If you hate it, tell an enemy.\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- All guitars are tuned a whole step down.\r\n- The Yays and the bridge have seven layered tracks of vocals. I love this stuff! :)\r\n- The lyrics are obviously about Fluttershy. Because she is best pony.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nI may not be the greatest flyer\r\nBut I never cared if I was fast\r\nWhile the other ponies were into racing\r\nI never cared if I came in last\r\nI sometimes get overly nervous\r\nI sometimes get overly scared\r\nBut you better not take me too lightly\r\nOr you might run afoul of \"The Stare\"(tm)\r\n\r\nYou may not think me courageous\r\nYou may just find me too mild\r\nI rarely raise my voice\r\nBut when I do things are about to get wild\r\nI may look like I got lots of control\r\nBut my passion is clear as day\r\nI might not scream and holler\r\nBut that doesn't mean I've nothing to say\r\nSo let me hear you say\r\nYay!\r\nYay!\r\n\r\nI may not be the biggest reader\r\nI never owned that many books\r\nI may not bake tastiest pastries\r\nI never really learned how to cook\r\nI may not know much about apples\r\nAnd fashion was never my scene\r\nBut I may come off as scary \r\nWhen my excitement gets the best of me\r\n\r\nYou may not think me assertive\r\nYou may just find me too shy\r\nI rarely come out of my shell\r\nBut when I do I make dragons cry\r\nI may look like I got lots of control\r\nBut my passion is clear as day\r\nI might not scream and holler\r\nBut that doesn't mean I've nothing to say\r\nSo let me hear you say\r\nYay!\r\nYay!\r\n\r\nI guess you always overlook the ones who aren't loud\r\nAnd I guess you'll never see me stick out of a crowd\r\nBut what I lack in volume I make up for in heart\r\n'Cause I always go the extra mile, there's no distance too far\r\nYeah!\r\n\r\nI sometimes wish I was more social\r\nI sometimes wish I were a tree\r\nI may not get a lot of attention\r\nBut that's just fine with me"

He's responsible for the disappearance of the Crystal Empire, among other things. Memories and mentioning his name brings pain. Id est aeternum malum. (For that IS evil).\r\n\r\nThe song also touches upon the Crystal Empire itself, and it's own epicness.\r\n\r\nComposed in: Logic Pro 9"

Why?\r\n\r\nIt's because it's a 4th anniversary of my YT account! And first when it's full of ponies. And we should celebrate that! At least I should! So... this is my small gift for you, guys. Normally I would post it later but hell - today's a special day!\r\n\r\nThis track is my vision about our mysterious villain. We don't know his name (but I like one I found on DA - Tyrrany), his abilities and powers... But for me he's a powerful magician which is able to control ponies minds... using gems. Thanks to that ability, he can easly take over whole Crystal Empire and make Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Applejack his puppets (that's why they have square reflections in the eyes on that DVD cover). But he wasn't able to control Rarity and Pinkie Pie... The first mare is specialist about gems and she easly noticed that these gems aren't normal. And Pinkie is just Pinkie - she rejects his reality.\r\nBut that wasn't very helpful because they're not as powerful in magic as Twilight, not strong like AJ and not as fast as Rainbow. For now Equestria is in ruins. Princesses are in dungeons and sun is staying in the same position all day and night. But ponies can't see it - skies are covered by grey clouds and it's raining...\r\nOnly Rarity, Pinkie Pie and Princess Cadance can make it right... But if they will succeed? Time will show."

She arrives at the Ponyville train station, where Apple Bloom introduces her to the other Cutie Mark Crusaders, who then show her the clubhouse and their giant pumpkin float for the Summer Harvest Parade. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon arrive shortly after and berate Babs for not having a cutie mark, which she seems self-conscious about. Ultimately, Babs makes fun of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, wrecks their float, and joins Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, Diamond Tiara commending Babs' \"big city attitude\". She then spends much of her time tormenting the Crusaders, who are scared of being \"snitches\" if they tell Applejack; the song, Babs Seed, from the episode depicts Babs chasing and bullying the Cutie Mark Crusaders. She even kicks them out of their clubhouse, forcing them to resort to drastic measures: Booby-trapping a float and enticing her to ride it herself in an attempt to ultimately humiliate her.\""

So much university work to do and no time...\r\n\r\nThis is the first track of my two-track EP \"The Darkening / The Redemption\", both tracks telling the story of a second Changeling attack on Canterlot and the desparate attempts of refugee ponies to save it.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that this one took over a month of production time, but I really wanted to make it as good as possible and polish it.\r\n\r\nThe track is dark, sad and progressive, yet with the hints of uplifting... Maybe a hope? We shall see...\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n\r\nKeep tuned in for the part two in the following months, \"The Redemption\"!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack mastered by HMage: http://www.youtube.com/user/HMageD\r\n\r\nThe amazing picture used in artwork was made by Raikoh-illust ( http://raikoh-illust.deviantart.com/ ). You should definitely go check out his work!"

This was a request by my roommate (you may know him as Lobstercraft). This was also a massive exercise in Pitcher; the a cappella track doesn't have any vocal harmonies in it, so I had to do them manually. I tried to get as many of the random noises and such from the show out of the vocal track as I could, but couldn't touch the ones that overlapped the vocals, so if you're hearing odd sounds, that's why.\r\n\r\nThe vocalist is Shannon Chan-Kent, possibly with some Andrea Libman in there. I have no way of knowing for sure, though.\r\n\r\nPicture by CobraCookies (http://cobracookies.deviantart.com)."

In my head, I pictured this odd cross between something by Daisuke Ishiwatari, because it's a fighting game, and Jun Senoue, because of the comparison everyone makes between Rainbow Dash and Sonic the Hedgehog. When I came home, I intentionally kept myself away from checking YouTube for RD's Fighting is Magic theme until I finished, so I could work solely on my own preconceived inspirations.\r\n\r\nThis is the result. Hope you guys enjoy."

And... I must say, I was kinda disappointed about it. Well, okay, that duel was nice and intensive but... it finished so quickly. Few spells and poof - Age spell which was too difficult for Twilie. \r\n\r\nIn my vision this duel lasts about half an hour. Both mares was throwing each other with different spells and magic tricks. The mana sparkles were everywhere. They both were very tired but then Trixie used her ultimate spell - that one which is changing target's age. Twilight knew that spell is difficult and very hard to use. It was in her reach but... not when she was that tired. But she can't surrender. She knew she must do something. So she tried to break this spell... and then she fall..."

The vocal harmonies were, of course, part of that whole catchy feel, and I didn't wanna give them up, but Pitcher didn't feel like playing nice with the a cappella track. So I found a singer! Bonus points to Corralfur for making it as painless as possible. Couldn't get rid of all of those odd noises in the original track, though. :(\r\n\r\nThe lead vocalists are Michelle Creber and Madeleine Peters.

Kept getting pushed back due to a rather busy schedule, but it's finally done! I had originally planned for the lead vocals to be entirely performed by Corralfur, but I didn't take into account her rather soft singing style, so I wasn't able to use the lead vocals she sent me for this track. I won't be letting that amazing performance I got from her go to waste, though. Expect to hear something a bit... softer... around the end of the year.  ;)\r\n\r\nThe lead vocalist is Kazumi Evans.

Ever since I created \"Hardcore Bronystyle\" , which is only seen on my Dailymotion page, I've created small hardstyle beats of some songs I was going to turn into full blown anthems. This was one of them. Now, since May 2, 2013, I've finally created an anthem worth jumping up and down to. \r\n\r\nI love the sh*t I can create with FL Studio!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Tokyo Magika Productions 2013.

        "description": "Devoted to Princess Celestia 1000+ years ago, back when ponies were new. Little bits of headcanon in this, but you can probably figure most of it out from the lyrics and monologue bits.Anyway, it's about Celestia, a lone alicorn, wandering through a chaotic world, cleaning up the assault of Discord and the spirits of chaos, turning them to stone. That bit about Luna? Take it however you will.\r\n\r\nDespite this song's existence and such, I still love Discord as a villain.\r\n\r\nWords:\r\n\r\nThis land has been ravaged by these demons, these spirits of chaos. None could have predicted their coming, nor the destruction they would bring with them. Cought off our guard, we were forced to watch helplessly as our home was transformed into hell.\r\n\r\nFirst, the chocolate rain and cotton candy clouds, innocent enough at first, but it wasn't long before Ponies lost their minds, and the world around them became so unpredictable, that nothing could be trusted. I was powerless to stop it, but I knew I had to try.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAcross the land, seeds of chaos are sewn.\r\nCommitting crimes I can never condone\r\nSo I relieve them of flesh and bone\r\nFor justice, I turn them to stone.\r\n\r\n----- \r\n\r\nI cannot find my way to any known landmark, as the landscape has been utterly transformed from the stationary one it has been for generations, to a constantly changing mess of floating islands and barren wastelands that were once fertile soil.\r\n\r\nThe only mortal beings that I can find amongst the madness are starving, fearful, and confused. The combination of the irregular ground, limited food and water, and tormenting spirits of disharmony have left them weak, suffering, and hopeless.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAcross the land, seeds of chaos are sewn.\r\nCommitting crimes I can never condone\r\nSo I relieve them of flesh and bone\r\nFor justice, I turn them to stone.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMy sister, the benevolent ruler of the moon, has been seperated from me. Whether by her own volition, or anothers is uncertain, but I feel a deep concern for her wellfare, a nagging doubt that she is as healthy as I.\r\n\r\nThis land may be healed once this terrible threat has been dealt with, but I'm sure that none alive to experience it, nor even the children of the future will emerge from the ashes unscathed. For nothing has ever gone this wrong, nor have my subjects ever needed me more.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAcross the land, seeds of chaos are sewn.\r\nCommitting crimes I can never condone\r\nSo I relieve them of flesh and bone\r\nFor justice, I turn them to stone.\r\n\r\nA cross the realm, I will wander alone,\r\nfight for order, in the monstrous unknown\r\nTill they're defeated with a ghastly moan\r\nFor This land, I turn them to stone."

And 'Smile' is a testament to her happiness.  \r\n\r\nI'll quietly go back to my collabs, but I wanted to take a break and really share how happy I am to be part of this bad ass group of fans.    \r\n\r\nTL:DR ~ You all make me very happy.  \r\n\r\n~Rhyme Flow \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nLyrics: \r\nI am the R-H-Y to the M-E \r\nFlow & I'm friendly\r\nRhymes in a Flow I got plenty.\r\n\r\nDiscorded Harmony & KOLT's what I'm repping. \r\nAnd I'm also attending all those \r\nSkype chats you send me. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm mainly here to say  \"Thank you\" \r\nfor all the goodwill.\r\nI'm addicted to you bronies like a \"Good Pill\" \r\n\r\nAnd I'm honored when I \r\nshare in all the good skill. \r\nI spit some verses, make some friends?  \r\nThat's a good deal. \r\n\r\nAnd all my subs and fans \r\nthis one's a song for you. \r\nDon't need Equestria Daily \r\nfor all them extra views.  \r\n\r\nJust pay attention to the fact that this track \r\nis a basic beat-box and a rap. \r\n\r\nAlso there's a little bit of \r\nsinging that I'll do here. \r\nI'll sound like a mule here... \r\nbut I love you all, \r\nso just screw fear. \r\n\r\nAnd I may not post a single in a while.\r\nBut I hope this flow will make you all smile. \r\n\r\nAnd it's true... some days are dark and lonely\r\nBut I'm only just a click away from \r\n\r\nMY LITTLE PONY\r\n\r\nAnd if Pinkie ain't enough to get my grin on... \r\nI hang with all my bronies online and I find my \r\nSmile has been on. \r\n\r\nSo if you see me just Get On...\r\nShoot me a hello, \r\nand I'll know that yall've been listen in on. \r\n\r\nAnd I'll smile wider than the sea. \r\nSmile brighter than the sun if it had high beams. \r\n\r\nAnd if I seem giddy and laugh at \r\nevery single joke.\r\nIt's the fact ~ that ~ \r\nFlowny's surrounded by great folk. \r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\nBring on the trolls and the Clop 'Baters.\r\nAnd you might as well include \r\nall the naysayers.\r\n\r\nRhyme Flow wields the Hate-Slayer.\r\nWith Equestria's army of bronies behind me my \r\nopposition makes prayers. \r\n\r\nSo raise your mug full of cider ~ \r\nyou've every reason to beam.\r\nHere's to Bronies as we enter Season 3. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nVIDEO SYNC BY:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/MrTechknowgeek"

As with my Twilight's Battle theme that i did a few \r\nmonths back, i wanted this one to just express and represent every side that Pinkie has. \r\nSo, i wanted the song to mainly be happy and upbeat, which it is, but i also wanted to show the sides of \r\nPinkie that aren't as joyfull. (Pinkamena for example) The thing is, when in a fight, no one would be able to\r\njust feel happiness, not even Pinkie. They would also feel sadness, and maybe even fear; i bet that Pinkie would\r\nbe afraid that she would permanently hurt her friends, and so on.\r\n\r\nSorry for the lack of updates the latest weeks, i've been busy. I've been making music for an android game\r\ncalled \"Blind Knight\". It will hopefully be released in a few weeks, so watch for it! \r\n"

He may not have been a very formidable foe, but he was certainly one of the more evil villains in the show.\r\n\r\nStory behind the song:\r\nKing Sombra and the Crystal Empire has returned, and the mane 6 go off to stop him, by rejuvenating the spirits of the crystal ponies as they search for the crystal heart.  Unfortunately for the crystal ponies, the mane 6 have failed.  As the crystal ponies enjoy their crystal fair, King Sombra is ready to enslave them once again, turning the crystal fair into a foreboding occasion.  The last dance of the crystal empire.\r\n\r\nEssentially this is a waltz to symbolize the crystal fair, with elements of dubstep/brostep (whatever you want to call it) to symbolize the nearing danger and ultimate end of all fun and luxury the crystal ponies have ever a known.  A death waltz, if you will."

The loser has to cover something that the winner chooses. Knowing that I like Celestia more than Luna, he chose \"For The New Lunar Republic\" by NACP. This had to be finished within 24 hours. Well what do you know, 12 hours later, 8 hours of sleep, and a 30 minute final, I still managed to whip out this song. I not going to lose as a pyro against a spy again. Not by 20 points. \r\n\r\nThe cover's in my usual style, and luckily the song is so easy to cover I can create my own midis in about 30 minutes, and finish the song in 3 hours. Much shorter than the days that it usually takes when I compose from scratch. \r\n\r\nSince I can't contact NACP, I have decided to donate 100% of the proceeds of this cover to the Seeds of Kindness.

        "description": "On 10/9/12 I wanted to celebrate my 500th Subscribers by doing something that would be challenging and fun.  I would field questions from my subbers and also have them vote on a beat by DJ Premiere.  I would select the winning beat and then make a song to answer each and every question.  Lastly I would have it done by 10/14/12 so it could be unveiled on Pegasisters Live. \r\n\r\nOn the morning of 10/14/12 I tallied, wrote, recorded, and delivered the song to the Pegasisters before the 7pm deadline.  Start to completion was roughly 12 hours.\r\n\r\nI've finally gotten around to putting a video to it, but I left it in the original version with all its beautiful imperfections as a testament to the love I have for my fans and this fandom. \r\n\r\nFor this Thanksgiving Weekend... this song is my thanks for reaching 688 subs! \r\n\r\nI may not be the #BetterMusician but I'm #NotAHorribleRapper. :D \r\n\r\nTL:DR - I answer commenter questions over DJ Primo's beat CNN Invincible \r\n\r\nLyrics: \r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/16blUEnwgClgZRb0LiRSnoQOoknzlchFSMaAY73mkbYU/edit\r\n\r\nPegasisters Live Episode: \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeJA5oalKbg"

Well... something went wrong and the project just stopped, because I don't have I-DE-AS to make PP and AJ themes. But now is different - the \"Six\" will be out soon! I quess it will be posted next week, few days after the S3 episodes. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAnyway, this track is about Twilight Sparkle and her so powerful magic. If she wants, she can do anything, just like that. \r\nAlso I know she isn't party pony but... Tara Strong is! And also oatmeal. Cosplaying Twilight... That was so oatmeal! So this is dedication to both Twilight and Tara. Funny the both have \"TS\" as initial."

Hopefully this is a track that tells us a little bit about ourselves, and who we are, or at least makes you think about it what many of those reasons could be. Hopefully a track you could play for a Trekkie or a parent and they might understand us better or be interested. Glad our track came together as it did and I hope you enjoy it.

        "description": "Ok first things first. This is a ponified cover of a New Order song. One of my favorite alternative dance bands and a track that instantly came to mind when i saw the Crystal Empire 2 parter (and one that didn't need a lot of lyric changing tbh). This has been delayed a bit until i got a vocalist and Evdog came through this last week and put some wonderful vocals on this track. Glad we finally got to work on something new together and there's more collabs to come between us. I did the rest of the music in a style of breakbeats but with a mix of shoegaze and electro. This track speaks to me in terms of how fragile we are as people (especially after the Connecticut tragedy) and also from pov of the crystal ponies who were both enslaved and forgotten (again, actually heavy stuff). Luckily i think love conquers all, even outside of Equestria. Anyway this is my last dark track for awhile and the next one should be a fun jazz-funk track.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this pmv and track (see the lyrics on the youtube)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BODQP-TNP9Y\r\n\r\nEvdog's youtube is http://www.youtube.com/user/EvdogMusic\r\n"

It's just been eye-opening to me on this project how FREAKING talented he is and how much work and layers he puts into a single track such as this.

Don't think it's anything great though, it's, however, catchy, and I was going for a very dynamic feeling, and I'm happy I didn't brickwall this so it is kinda dynamic both in the mixing kind of sense and in the melodies kind of sense, I guess :D\r\n\r\nI love this pic; recently found it, really cool! Kinda gets you in the mood to listen. I wonder who plays all the other violins and cellos in all these Octavia songs :S\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, this one is fairly simmilar to A touch of variation, with which I was planning to do a, sort of, collection of songs around Octavia, hence why this was started in March, and worked on troughout the year. Maybe I'll make some kind of a free Octavia EP in the future with similar songs, if you like them :) Encourage me, I'm lazy xD Or not, if it's horrible :D\r\n\r\nAnyways, merry Christmas to all the Catholic folk, Happy Holidays for the rest of us, and may the force be with us.\r\n\r\nKredicz:\r\n\r\nOriginal art by gign-3208: http://gign-3208.deviantart.com/art/Octavia-332075395\r\n\r\n-CS"

        "description": "[800-Subscribers-Special!] \r\nThis is the title-track for my MLP Metal Album: Dethurge \r\nThank you all so very much for the support! \r\n\r\nThis song has been under works, and under the rug, for about 2 years now, if not more.\r\nIt's the first song I ever composed and it was just meant as a practice song for Guitar Hero; with medium fast solos and a fun riff in between. \r\nHowever, I later on wanted to make something more with it. So I added more parts, instruments and bunch of other stuff like time signature changes. Basically made it more progressive. \r\n\r\nBPM: 190\r\nTime Signatures: 4/4, 7/8, 15/8, 9/8\r\n\r\nThe song is about the battle between Pinkie Pie and her darker side; Pinkamena, who takes over her body and mind. I'm not going to explain too much since it's more fun if you try to figure out yourself what's going on. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------- \r\nDownload Section: \r\n-------------------------------- \r\nFLAC: http://goo.gl/yDeIr\r\nMP3: http://goo.gl/xXJM7\r\n\r\nSeparate tracks for charting: http://goo.gl/bpqJc\r\n\r\nCD Artwork (1000x1000): http://goo.gl/oYTmD\r\nVideo Artwork (1920x1080): http://goo.gl/Sn4Y2\r\n-------------------------------- \r\n\r\nPinkamena artwork by epicplatypus: \r\nhttp://epicplatypus.tumblr.com/image/31271593258 \r\n\r\nEquipment: \r\n-Schecter Omen 6 \r\n-Peavey Vypyr 75W \r\n-AKG C 535 EB\r\n-Xenyx 302 USB \r\n\r\nMixed and mastered in Cubase 5 \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nSoundCloud - http://soundcloud.com/CrimzonAE \r\nFacebook - http://mlpf.im/CrimzonFB \r\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/CrimzonAE \r\nTumblr - http://CrimzonAE.tumblr.com \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------"

What i tried to do with this remix was change the concept of the song almost entirely (may not have exactly succeeded but yea.) Instead of HARD i tried to do a complete spin and mix up the styles the most i could. From pretty DnB to hip hop swing to Moombah etc... Sadly the track kind of flopped and ended up well...kind of like the title of the song. Decided to upload it anyway because of the time spent on it. I don't have any fancy video or anything sorry i don't have the stuff to do that type of thing.  \r\n\r\nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/TreTheCrusader  \r\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/RealtremilCH2\r\nTumblr (Yea i made one) : http://tremil.Tumblr.com"

Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle were good friends to\r\ntry cheering Applebloom up, but it's something she had to\r\nlearn to do on her own. Every fire can be reignited.\r\nShort term gain and\r\nimpulse acts land\r\nyou in quicksand\r\nso understand\r\neven though you think\r\nyour plan's out of sync\r\nrunning without stride\r\nyou must learn to bide\r\n/chorus"

        "description": "just a little side note:\r\n\r\nThis song is mainly an experimental song.\r\n\r\nThe mixing in it is not perfect, and it\u2019s not meant to be. For this song, I kind of wanted the mixing to be\u2026 Different. My goal here was not to make everything super clear, or super mushed. It\u2019s actually really hard to explain what I wanted to go for with it, but um, yeah.\r\n\r\nIt sounds weird saying that, and it is. I don\u2019t know why I wanted it like this, but something just told me I had to do it this way.\r\n\r\nALSO, you might notice a slight little part or two in the piano where something goes off note, or a quick pause in the piano so it sounds sort of like someone messing up. That was completely intentional. Having actually played piano, I know it\u2019s pretty hard to avoid error, especially when something is over 4 minutes long, so I added a couple subtle errors in there to make it feel a bit more\u2026 Real.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it\u2019s not meant to be perfect at all. You might love it, you might hate it.\r\n\r\nArt: http://assasinmonkey.deviantart.com/art/Skies-of-Fires-322743842"

I was planning to make an album with a track dedicated to all Mane6 characters. But somehow I wasn't able to finish it as fast as I wanted to. Seriously, I was planning to finish Six before Spring... But my I-DE-AS are different. Finally that project come to an end. And... I'm so glad I made it. \r\n\r\nTracklist isn't random. I set the tunes in order we met our Mane6 ponies. From Twilight Sparkle to Pinkie Pie (for me Twilie and Pinkie first met when PP made a party for her). And for these who will download the whole album, there will be also a hi-res bonus - old version of Magic is Powerful.\r\n\r\nAnd this one is a chillout and calm track about AJ resting under an apple tree and watching her farm.\r\n\r\nSo... enjoy with them and let me know what are you thinking about the track and whole album in comments!"

How will you decide where you\u2019re going\r\n\r\n[refrain] Calling out your name\r\nTrying to find you\r\nThere's no one to blame\r\nOh\r\nYou are not the same\r\nYou are the only one\r\nwho put this friendship first\r\nWe love you\r\n\r\nHave you too little time - or just too much to think\r\nYou're the one who picks us up, we should've done something\r\nIf you could be more places at once, what would that mean for us?\r\nYou'd be there for your friends but would it be the one we trust?\r\nI don't know if you realize how powerful you are\r\nLet life happen, it will change you in ways you could never know\r\nYou say you like surprises but you can't stand letting go\r\nYou'll never be left behind, so don't worry\r\nYour friends are here and now, what\u2019s the hurry?\r\n\r\nYou gotta think before you act , if you don\u2019t - you might wish you could take it all back -\r\nThe more energy you subtract, the more work it will take for you to recharge, as a matter of fact -\r\nGive a little thought to ponies that sing differently, there is no symmetry here without sympathy\r\nYou\u2019ve got to be - reminded who this effort is directed to and find a way to let your friends finally relax\r\nBreathe - a line behind the shapes we can percieve, to actualize everything we believe\r\nSee - observe the scene with your keen intellect the thread that ties everything we are hoping to be\r\nWe ponies are like a tree, the words we say are just leaves - Be flattened to the ground by a breeze, but we\u2019ll always\r\nbe connected to the source of our unity - don\u2019t let it go, it\u2019s part of what it means to be\r\n- The common wisdom's nothing's easy as Pie, but it's genuinely hard sometimes - some\r\ntimes there are things that just trouble her mind, - so she finds escape hidden in old rhymes - You should\r\nremember something: there's a difference between breaking a record and having a good time - but I\r\nwonder if there's anyone who doesn't break down, - please don't frown, it'll be just fine\r\nGiven a difference between a difficult choice - and another decision equally hard to make\r\nThere\u2019s a point when you have to let it all go and be present in the moment, no mistake\r\nLyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics lyrics, lyrics lyrics lyrics, more lyrics, oh god"

So I made some of my own!\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the MLP universe is the story of the Royal Sisters. There's a sense of... humanity and emotion that really doesn't show in a lot of mythology. I wanted to capture the feeling of being trapped on the moon for a thousand years - that weird mixture of pain and anger and sorrow and defeat that blurs the line between Luna and Nightmare Moon.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope you all enjoy!\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\n\r\nI can't pretend what I touch is gold\r\nSo I took a chance and I sold my soul\r\nIt's not hard to dream, it's hard to let go\r\nDear sister left me, now I'm alone\r\n\r\nAnd in this desperate time I'm a sinner\r\nAnd in this world of mine, where moonlight shines\r\nIt's the end of the line\r\n\r\nOne thousand years in the dark and cold\r\nThis pain is young, my soul is old\r\n\r\n'Cause in this desperate time I'm a sinner\r\nAnd in this world of mine, where moonlight shines\r\nIt's the end of the line\r\n\r\nAnd oh, dear sister mine - can't forgive her\r\nI've got my hate but it never withers\r\n'Cause in this desperate time I'm a sinner\r\nAnd in this world of mine, where moonlight shines\r\nIt's the end of the line"

There\u2019s just a physical space between us. A transversable space. \r\nBut there\u2019s still a pretty amazing circle of friends that I hang out with (almost) daily. \r\nThese are great people. \r\nWatching MLP did not change my life. Instead, it introduced me to all of these amazing people. \r\nThey are the ones that changed my life. \r\nI love my friends. "

        "description": "I've been meaning to do this track for months. I had originally planned on tracking this sometime in the early spring, but I had an OverClocked ReMix album to finish, which ended up taking way more out of my personal time than I had originally planned. Thankfully, I have a break in handling the logistics of that massive undertaking to get this finished.\r\n\r\nI knew right when I heard this track that its minor key and tone would translate really well into metal, and immediately had ideas for much of the track. They didn't get out until months later, but as they did, more ideas formed. This may be the best use I've gotten out of Pitcher; I've learned a lot about that VST, and was able to make a pretty convincing backing harmony track for this (still <3 ya though, Corralfur). The melodies sound fantastic when put to the amp as well. Overall, this was a really fun track to make.\r\n\r\nThis release personally represents a major shift for me in terms of my outlook on the brony fandom. A lot has happened between when I released my \"Winter Wrap-Up\" cover and this track. The biggest factor in how I've come to view the fandom wasn't all the bad I saw in the fandom during that time (especially what I saw recently in what I thought was the last little bit of good left in the fandom), but rather how fulfilling \"Gunstar Heroes: Be Aggressive!\" has been. I realized that I was wasting my time attempting to fix the brony music scene, using efforts like Brony Music Spotlight and pushing heavily for a judge-based artist/music featuring system on Pony.fm, when it was apparent from the major sites' insistence on pushing mediocrity and stifling talent and the mindless drones' willingness to drink that mediocrity up in huge quantities that the brony music scene simply doesn't want to be fixed. Meanwhile, all the time and effort I've put into my dealings at OverClocked ReMix have been respected quite a bit, and the album isn't even out yet!\r\n\r\nSo this track, like all future pony covers that I'll make, isn't made for the masses. It isn't made for recognition, or e-fame, or even respect by other brony musicians in the community. I didn't submit it to Equestria Daily so it could be rejected by Sethisto, being a whiney child who can't take criticism while protecting his \"all-star\" regulars from guys like me that blow them out of the water. And I can't submit it to Everfree Radio because I'm banned for making things too convenient, but even if I weren't, I wouldn't sub it there anyway to watch the bronypop influence show just how prominent it is. I made this track fully aware that, despite it being some of the best brony metal you will ever hear, and likely the only cover of this song uploaded anywhere on the Internet that actually does the source true metal justice, I will never reach a level of recognition that so many with lesser talent have managed to achieve simply because they were \"here\" first.\r\n\r\nNo, I did this for me, for the same reason I started doing MLP metal covers in the first place: I wanted to challenge myself in a unique way and make what I can't hear anywhere else on the Internet; high quality metal covers of songs from this amazing show. And if you like my music, I did this for you too, and I thank you immensely, both for your support, and for not being part of a problem that was simply too big for me to fix.\r\n\r\nVocals by Rebecca Shoichet (show audio rip)."

They read your mind, then start creating illusions designed to scare you. As you become more afraid, they feed off that fear and use it to make the illusions worse and worse until you die. They can also use their illusions to enslave wild beasts. Both species are trying to invade Equestria, but are being kept at bay by a secret army called the Everfree Rangers. The war needs to be kept secret because if it became public knowledge, there could be a mass panic, strengthening the terrormongers, enabling them to destroy Equestria. Shining Armor is one of the Rangers, and through somewhat complicated circumstances goes on an emergency mission into the forest with Twilight and Rainbow Dash. When they're camping on the first night, Shining Armor tells them the story of Denorious:\r\nDenorious was a pegasus Ranger with a silver coat, golden mane and a cutie mark of a ray of light breaking through black storm clouds. Shining Armor says she was the fastest Pegasus ever recorded, which Rainbow Dash disputes, but then it turns out Denorious was at least 20% faster, (probably more like 40%,) making Rainbow Dash extremely jealous. Twilight tries to cheer her up, but then finds out Denorious had an IQ 13 points higher then hers, making Twilight extremely jealous. Shining Armor then goes on about how Denorious was a legendary tactician, who could inspire hope in any circumstance, that she was incredibly beautiful and how most of the Ranger stallions had a crush on her.\r\nDenorious began as a Jr. Sheriff in Manehatten. After annihilating a massive crime ring; Denorious was flooded with offers of promotion and Celestia offered to take her as her personal protege, but refused them and instead became a Ranger, believing it was the best way she could serve others. Denorious shot through the Ranger ranks; and eventually defeated an Ursa Major in single combat, saved Equestria and became leader of the Rangers. (The point this song was theoretically written.)\r\nSpoiler!  Spoiler!  Spoiler!\r\nFor a short time the Rangers are advancing, but eventually Denorious is captured by the terrormongers, who savagely torture her. By the time she's rescued, the terrormongers have destroyed her memories and replaced them with several hundred years of false memories where she can do nothing but watch, and blame herself, as all life in the world dies agonizing deaths, only to be resurrected over and over so they can die even more horribly. Denorious suffered irrevocable neurological damage, severe brain damage and had tried to gouge out one of her own eyes in a futile effort to stop the images.\r\nThe Rangers race Denorious to Celestia, who manages to partially heal her eye, but can't do anything to restore her mind. The only thing Celestia can offer is a memory block which will give her complete amnesia and make her cutie mark disappear. The block is going to be weak, however, meaning that if Denorious ever sees any of the Rangers, hears any of their voices, or learns anything about the war or her past life; all the false memories could come flooding back in an instant, permanently destroying her mind.\r\nThe Rangers hate this, but are forced to swear an oath never to contact Denorious for any reason. Many Rangers, however, still refuse to believe Denorious is truly gone and say that she will return to lead them in their hour of greatest need.\r\nThe last thing that Shining Armor ever heard of Denorious, was that she had become a mail-mare in a small town and began calling herself Derpy.\r\nThen Rainbow Dash has eleven heart attacks in a row, and Twilight's head blows up.\r\n(Note: this is a side story; I haven't given away much of the main plot.)"

        "description": "Okay, this isn't a serious song, but it's also not a troll.\r\n\r\nThis is for the S3 Finale Synopsis TB compilation. I figured since there is such a huge and overly dramatic reaction, why not make a parody song that draws a musical picture of the situation.\r\n\r\nYes, I openly admit that the vocals BLOW. Keep in mind, this was rushed because of schedule conflicts and my voice was completely shot by the time the vocal track was finished (mainly due to a huge number of failed takes and a horrible sinus infection that I was going through).\r\n\r\nHowever, this song was meant to be laughed with or at. You choose.\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nThat's weird it starts with a teaser, rough sketches, and spoilers. M.A. Larson is not afraid.\r\nEye of the flamestorm, watch as the world burns, fans serve their own needs, staring in disbelief, kick it up a notch please, love no, flame with, boards such a clutter with fear fights - sad sights\r\n\r\nAfire and conspire, the theories all the same, all of ponychan becomes a combat sight.\r\n\r\nVideos being banned in a hurry with Hasbro breathing down you neck.\r\n\r\nTwo by two, bronies baffled from all the hype. Look at that new plot! Oh...well...\r\n\r\nUh oh, there they go, fears too common for the bronies to save thierself, hide yourself from all the world greed Hasbro wants to breed, Celestia coming  with the Rapture in her flight, right?\r\n\r\nYou whine about it, cry about it, i'm-right-hype-gripe, fillies fall aside.\r\n\r\nIt's the end of the fandom as we know it (3x)\r\nAnd I could cry~\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, Pony hour, heart attack for an hour, not what you want in turn, watch as the plot turns, looking for the alicorn, hope burning for magic, quickly to escalate, episode-incenerate. Why did Lauren Faust have to step down, step down? The fandom is crushed, crushed.\r\n\r\nUh oh, this means they're here, troll fears, from the rear, steer clear - a trolling, a trolling, a tolling of lies! Littlest Pet Shop as an alternative, but I decline.\r\n\r\nIt's the end of the fandom as we know it (multiple times)\r\nAnd I could cry~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe others fight, drift alike, but love is really nice, what about all the hype? Friendship survives! Remember that, scratch that, what about Pinkie's Party that time, just like a Sonic Rainboom\r\n\r\nWe'll rise above it, gotta love it, we're still friends... right? RIGHT!\r\n\r\nIt's the end of the fandom as we know it (3x)\r\nAnd I could cry~"

Now go exploring. :P\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\nVerse 1:\r\nThere's a part of you that wants to demonstrate what beauty is,\r\nAnd you want to reveal the parts of life that people rarely glimpse,\r\nBut the world greets you with a slap to the face, and an industry with narrow tastes,\r\nAnd you wonder if your voice will be heard at all.\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nYou try each day to better yourself, but you never make it, you don't make it.\r\nYou throw away all your older work, because it reminds you  of who you'll never be\r\nYou look at all of the other guys who make is so easy, they make it so easy.\r\nYou lie awake at night wondering if you're even half as good as everyone knows that you are.\r\n\r\nVerse 2:\r\nYou wonder why you're failing: why you just can't scale this wall,\r\nAnd you start to really wonder why you ever followed this call,\r\nBut that core of love, it still remains and it's naggin' at your heart.\r\nThat desire inside you's the first love that brought you to be here at the start.\r\n\r\nQuote by Ira Glass: http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish\r\n\r\nBridge:\r\nYou can make it easier on yourself if you understand we all feel the same way you do.\r\nEven those you look up to; Even those who look up to you."

HHNNGGG!!!!\" With that being said and the fact that I love Applejack more than the other 5, I was extremely hesitant to remix it cause I didn't want to mess it up. I saw some people remixing it in all genres (first I listened to was metapony's metal cover) and decided to just go for it.\r\n\r\nThis took...a while to finish really. In any case, when I finished the house portion, I decided to try something new and make another genre within the remix, happy hardcore of course :P.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I hope you guys like this ^_^\r\nYoutube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkIsbXVgjXM"

I decided to go more for the progression of the mood of the episode instead of a specific theme or character. It starts off with Dash and the other waiting for the letter, and in the same area, Dash's travel and welcoming to the academy. It's light-hearted, soft, and generally airy with just a hint of punch. The next movement is her beginning training, specifically with Lightning Dust. It picks up quite a bit of speed, lots of movement and different things going on, and drums to demonstrate both Dash's and Dust's hard-hitting attitudes. The next section is when the tornado starts stirring about, nearly killing Dash's friends and where Dash decides she might just quit the team. It's a darker part of the episode, and in a way, kind of intense. Finally, it ends with Dash being accepted back into the Academy, the training continuing, and everything in general turning out alright.\r\n\r\nPlease interpret any part as you wish, though. These were merely my initial intentions.\"\r\n\r\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/nulrei/allies-with-lightning\r\n\r\nFacebook Page: http://www.facebook.com/TunerSymphon?fref=ts\r\n\r\nCover art by Overmare: http://overmare.deviantart.com/"

I'll see you all in the near future, don't cause any disasters while I'm away!\r\n\r\nThis is a mashup remix of Celestia's Ballad with the BIONICLE motifs, a fitting mixture if I do say so myself. It's fun to see how the two universes can fit so well. It's also kind of complementing.\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy. =)\r\n\r\nVectors used:\r\nhttp://lightningtumble.deviantart.com/art/Gotta-take-a-break-310186490\r\nhttp://nictendo.deviantart.com/art/Happyshy-216195414\r\nhttp://sirspikensons.deviantart.com/art/Marching-Pinkie-Face-287475200\r\nhttp://flizzick.deviantart.com/art/Rarity-Vector-Challenge-322830589\r\nhttp://anxet.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-Vector-Angry-Face-316914908\r\nhttp://ackdari.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-I-ve-got-you-323098722\r\n\r\nBIONICLE wallpaper:\r\nhttp://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120113231549/bionicle/images/c/ce/Toa_Mata.jpg"

I've been feeling... \"Homesick\"... ...for Equestria.\r\n\r\nI can't really explain it... but that doesn't make the feelings any less real.\r\n\r\nSo, when I heard \"Isle of Inisfree,\" a Celtic song about a displaced soul longing for their home... I knew just had to rewrite it to match how I was feeling.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever felt this too... I hope this song makes the longing a little easier knowing that there are others who feel it as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nI've met some folks who say that I'm a dreamer,\r\nAnd I've no doubt there's truth in what they say,\r\nBut sure a body's bound to be a dreamer,\r\nWhen all the things she loves are far away.\r\nAnd precious things are dreams unto an exile.\r\nThey bring her home to a land so magical\r\nAnd in her heart she's once again pony,\r\nIn her dear lovely home, Equestria.\r\n\r\nWhen this world's moon rises beyond the rooftops,\r\nOf this great city, with wonders near and far,\r\nI scarcely feel the bright lights or the turmoil...\r\nI'm home again in my Equestria.\r\n\r\nI wander o'er green hills through dreamy valleys,\r\nAnd find a peace no other land would know.\r\nI hear the birds make music fit for angels,\r\nAnd watch the rivers laughing as they flow.\r\nAnd back to Ponyville my hooves they take me,\r\nMy dear old home and tenderly behold,\r\nPonies I love around the village, gathered.\r\nAnd I relive their friendships young and old.\r\n\r\nBut dreams don't last\r\nThough friends are not forgotten\r\nAnd soon I'm back to harsh reality.\r\nBut even if they paved the roads with gold here,\r\nI still would choose my dear Equestria.\r\n"

Read the chapter: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/9767/7/moonbeam/harvest-time .\r\n\r\nFor context, start reading at \u201cThe next few hours, chatter was at a minimum\u201d, about 80% into the chapter. Play this music starting at the words \u201cPinkie Pie started to hum a tune\u201d, and ending at \u201cEveryone finished together.\u201d\r\n\r\n[i]Moonbeam[/i] provided the lyrics and structure of the song. I made up the tune, sang every voice part, and wrote the backing tracks. The production of the song is amateurish, but hopefully at least the song goes well with the description of the song in the story.\r\n\r\nI recorded this because of a comment on the chapter asking what tune the song sould be sung to. I decided to share the tune that I had made up. At first, I recorded a simpler, sloppier version of the song. I finished that in 40 minutes, right after which my audio recording program crashed and I lost my work. Then I made this better version in 2 hours using GarageBand. I know some parts would be better after re-recording, but the current version is good enough for me."

        "description": "And... here we are.  \r\n\r\nIt hasn't been a year yet, and I am honored to bring you a song to celebrate a number of subs I still really haven't grasped.  In truth this number is irrelevant.  You've all been very important to me since subscriber 1.  But it's important to at least gauge where we started, and where we're at right now.\r\n\r\nMy good friend Koroshi-ya was right... you can have thousands of subs... but if you hardly get any views when you send something out (that doesn't get EQD), it shows the quality of the people that follow you.\r\n\r\nWhen songs like \"Keep Calm Daddy-O\" and my Christmas song have 400-500 views... it really makes me smile.  even if 100 of you are listening to them 4-5 times...  it means a ton to me.  I would take that over 1000 people viewing it once... and then moving on with their lives... XD\r\n\r\nI'm going to try very hard this year to bring you more music.  More collaborations... and work my hooves off to bring my lyrics and delivery to more of you who haven't heard me yet.\r\n\r\nThis year I'm going to BronyCon to perform live for the first time.  If that's a success... I'm going to start performing at future cons.\r\n\r\nExpect a MASSIVE compilation album (I.Am.Rhyme.Flow) out in the next month that has ALL of my EQD Featured Songs from 2012 to go on sale in Band Camp.\r\n\r\nFinally, some notes on this song... Buffalo came to me with the original collaboration idea.  I think I coined the name 'Elevation', and we wrote about our origin stories... and about how aspiring rappers should keep their head up and keep elevating their skills.  I always come back to these lyrics for inspiration and to see my own origins.  But the alternate meaning of Re-Elevate & Remember is to take a step back from this sometimes over-sized and stressful community and really try to think on why we do what we do.\r\n\r\nIt's a look back on 2010, when this fandom was just getting off the ground and guys were writing music for it... because they WANTED to.  They knew they were a minority, and weren't looking for recognition.  They just loved a show so much that they were INSPIRED TO CREATE MUSIC FOR IT.\r\n\r\nSo remember why you love this show, and with that feeling: re-elevate yourself.  \r\n\r\nGet THIS song for free at:\r\n\r\n \r\nDonate if you'd like!  Every dollar gets me one step closer to Baltimore! \r\nhttp://flowny.bandcamp.com/track/re-elevate-remember\r\n\r\nTL:DR - Thanks for the 1k subs. Let's keep going. \r\n\r\nOriginal Beat & Chrous: Do You Remember by Jay Sean ft. Sean Paul & Lil' Jon \r\nVisualizer by VINXIS \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/OYKXF\r\nMC Flowny's New Cutie Mark by Tali Togisala"

Pegasus Pitch helped me a lot again, this time critiquing my singing and editing again (thank you sooooooo much by the way). He even put his own project on hold for me (you didn't have to do that btw). His selfless actions WILL BE remember! Your awesome Pegasus Pitch :D Okay, Moon Rises was originally done by Ponyphonic, which can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPjVCI...

I think he sounds JUST like Flim in this, and maybe he could actually give the REAL actor a run for his money! Let me know what you guys think of him (and of the performance in general). PegaPitch has helped me so much already in most of my recent videos, and I hope that I can continue working with him longterm. Thank you as always to all of my subscribers and those who support me. And as always, God bless! Hasbro owns My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic."

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\r\n\r\nSay what you will about Somber and his massive book, \"Project Horizons,\" but it's given me a lot of enjoyment over the past several months.  The characters are vivid and the backstory is DEEP.\r\n\r\nThis is my take on one of the songs written into the book.  The lyrics, as far as I know, are a parody of William Blake's \"The Tiger\" done up by Somber.  I made slight adjustments to the lyrics and arrangement.  I also made the musics.  The female voice is once again, Metal-Mare.\r\n\r\nYouTube: http://youtu.be/cZQzUziy1jY\r\n\r\nDownload: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?6kismx8fros11mb\r\nDownload the vinyl-ish version (for you lo-fi lovers): http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?05hshpawuhdh94k\r\n\r\nFallout: Equestria by Kkat, the story that started it all: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html\r\nFallout: Equestria - Project Horizons by Somber: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/fallout-equestria-project-horizons.html\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nThe Pony\r\n\r\nPony, Pony, rage resound\r\nIn the stable underground,\r\nWhat immortal horn or hoof\r\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\r\nIn what fallen city or land\r\nDid your spirit break so grand?\r\nHow much pain did you endure\r\nTo protect and life secure?\r\n\r\nAnd what friends and what love\r\nCould lift your heart up above?\r\nAnd when your tears began to fall,\r\nWhat dread sorrow held you in thrall?\r\n\r\nWhat the shotgun? What the flame?\r\nIn what torment birth your shame?\r\nThat the rifle? What dread eye\r\nGuides your bullets as they fly?\r\n\r\nWhen your guns and pistols roar\r\nAnd promise doom and death in store\r\nDo you smile, your work to see?\r\nDo you kill, to be set free?"

After a while of having the first verse wrote, I kinda forgot about it. Then I heard THIS instrumental and the second verse was born. I put the 2 togerther (Lazyness FTW) and had to decide which version I liked better. THe version on High Road. I decided I liked this one a bit better so I got to work contacting a few people to help me out and do a few voices. That's the basic story so enjoy!"

I hope you enjoy it - and please tell me what you think!\r\n\r\nIt seems a tad useless to put a \"buy\" link here on EQbeats, but if you happen to enjoy the song and have a dollar lying around somewhere... I would appreciate a purchase :P https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/legend-north-pure-hearts-theme/id635732393?i=635732465\r\n\r\nThe great artist behind the album art background pic: http://tuyla.deviantart.com/art/Dovetail-OC-pony-358100424"

Basically it's kind of like, Terminator + ponies or something. 1984 is kind of a reference to that one apple commercial, it also sounded cool shutup. Drum samples are from an Alesis HR-16. A bunch of samples are from G1. They say:\r\n\r\n\"Play it again Spike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something must be wrong\"\r\n\r\n\"You're from the future\" (G4 Twilight Sparkle)\r\n\r\n\"Time is of the essence\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not scientifically possible, YOU'RE not scientifically possible!!\" (G4 Twilight Sparkle)\r\n\r\n\"They can't stop the Smooze, NOTHING CAN STOP THE SMOOZE!!\"\r\n\r\nBecause...uh...Skynet is the smooze."

Some of you will like this and some of you will absolutely hate this. I don't really know how to play the guitar, I more or less winged it. I know nothing of musical theory in this area. My mixing and mastering is far from acceptable for a professional (dare I say post)-rock song This is a messy track, its dissonant, sometimes off, but I like it. And that's what my music is about.

This is the third of my Twilogy (doh) about our new alicorn princess and another show remix from the finale. So if I've Got to Find a Way was the fandom's reaction with sadness, The Professor was try to get our head to accept why this happened, and then this track is ultimately about happiness and acceptance with that decision (she deserved that promotion!!). Anyway that's the thought. This is the first part of MANY songs that Dreamsong and i are collaborating on with each other! In fact it's expanded to a fourth eventual album done between the both of us. "

This also is a bit of a James Bond tribute (50 years woohoo) as we both love Shirley Bassey, John Barry, and the music catalog of that series.  So enjoy this crossover (and go see Skyfall it's great). Hopefully this mix of orchestral, hip-hop, and rock satisfies everyone. Dreamsong was AMAZING on this track and did fantastic vocals and wonderful flute work and we're working on a joint album of ponified covers together (collabs and solo). It's just been a blast working with someone around my age, who's so talented, and easy to get along with. "

I spent a bit of time the last 2 days trying to make a dream house cover and pmv for it so hope you enjoy it as I haven't put together a track \"quickly\" in a long time (altogether about 10 hrs). Luckily EQD spotlighted and tacked on as a bonus track track to my U+I album as I was a little saddened that i didn't have a new track or much of a draw to get people to download it. It's success was a big mental and creative boost. "

While many questions have been asked by the brony community about Twilicorn, the Professor Pony gets to the bottom of them all in one of his fabulous rap lectures. All the music samples were hunted down from the original records and not from sample packs (like back in the day). I know this is left field from me but as always i like to try a bity of everything and i think this turned out well and showed off my love for sampling. "

Just because everything is in chaos, and it feels like the world is at its end, there is always hope at the end of the tunnel. No matter what happens, keep up the spirit. \r\nEven after a long and gruesome war, there is time to rebuild."

This was a surprise gift which means we had to get as many people involved who would want to contribute and yet keep it a secret. While I wish I could have done much more with the remix if i had a midi or stems I was able to give the original a remix which turned into into a deep house track. Mine may be one of the weaker tracks creatively but I think the album is an amazing testament to SGAP's creativity and how that sparks other's imaginations and music. "

What if the cheerful Ponyville\r\ninstead was replaced with a dark city, filled with fame, glory, crime, romance and detectives.\r\n\r\nTried to make it rather smooth and slightly sexy but still keeping it a bit classy \r\nand harmonic. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis one was really fun to make, and I hope you enjoy it."

        "description": "There's a little bit of a story behind this song, so please bear with me.\r\n\r\nA few months ago I heard a terrific song by the inimitable DrDycer, about probably the most famous and well-written alicorn OC to ever grace the My Little Pony fandom, Nyx from Pen Stroke's \"Past Sins\". To me, though, DrDycer's song sounded like the unplugged acoustic version of some epic metal tune, and I felt compelled to create my own version.\r\n\r\nOriginally I had another singer lined up to do the vocals for this, but due to various circumstances she's been unable to record it. So after having this recording sit around on my computer for a few months I decided to have a go at singing it myself ... well turns out it's just slightly out of my comfortable vocal range so I'm not 100% happy with it, but perhaps some of you will enjoy this song anyway.\r\n\r\nTrivia: I think this was actually the first song I recorded on my 7-string, before I'd gotten proper strings for it. (I had a bass string standing in for the low A. The ball stuck out the back of the guitar and looked ridiculous.)\r\n\r\nWords and music by DrDycer. His original version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXbOfCWakE.\r\n\"Past Sins\" by Pen Stroke: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/41596/past-sins\r\nCover art: http://taionafan369.deviantart.com/art/Nyx-srs-Face-True-Vector-323840893\r\n"

However; just a few days\r\nago, I started working on a new song. That song is happy, melodi and filled with upbeat melodies; hopefully\r\nmost of you will enjoy that one.\r\n\r\nBig, big, biiiiig thanks to Diggidoo for drawing the picture for me!

Flutterwonder was one of the first pony tracks I loved, and I think it is fitting I remix it~\r\n\r\nI'd love to give my thanks to everyone who prelistened and gave me advice, but I'd especially love to give my special thanks to Assertive Fluttershy, Sleepypony, SMOR3S, and Brightcake for some specific and very well needed criticism and improvement suggestions! This track wouldn't have turned out the way it did without y'all\r\n-------\r\nVideo by Chang31ing: http://www.youtube.com/user/CHANG31ING\r\nCheck out his channel~\r\n\r\nBonus production bits:\r\n\r\nIntro drums at half speed, from BrightCake, sounds hiphoppish\r\nhttp://mushrooshi.com/sounds/FlutterWonderHipHop.mp3\r\n\r\nDid \"Bass Boost +12dB\" for the lulz\r\nhttp://mushrooshi.com/sounds/BASSBOOSTEDBITCH.mp3\r\n-------\r\nSince this was my 2nd track, I was basing it off of a few tracks I really liked. They were:\r\n\r\nMemory Lane by Netsky\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG7cRDcPY3k\r\nPaint it Black by Sigma\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSadxp_IcRo\r\nRegrowth by Addictia\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5KX_e5JKnA\r\nBooHoo by Assertive Fluttershy\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsHgV3jOE8\r\n\r\nOh yeah, about Regrowth, I totally stole the idea for a scrolling cityscape in the background, and Chang31ing went with it :P"

Dark, cold, sad... Everypony lived in fear of the dark ruler, living as slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Blackened Empire\" was inspired by these thoughts. It recreates the life of ponies living under Sombra's rule, and also shows it from his own perspective.\r\n\r\nThe track is heavily contrasted with sad orchestral breaks and dark, aggressive bass sections.\r\n\r\nThere are both the Original Mix and the Club Mix available for your listening pleasure. Original Mix has a moody orchestral intro, while the Club Mix is more suited towards DJs, having a clubby intro.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't released anything new in months, was trying to perfect this one the whole time. I started working on it back when Season 3 aired with some breaks in production, trying to find what works best. I hope it was worth it in the end, sorry for the huge delay.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to purchase a pair of studio monitors I'm after, however it's going slowly as my only source of income at the moment are donations... I would like to thank everyone who has donated so far!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack mastered by HMage: http://www.youtube.com/user/HMageD\r\n\r\nThe amazing picture used in the cover art was made by :iconcmaggot:. You should definitely go check out his work!"

        "description": "\"One is a cellist playing at Canterlot's most elite parties. The other is a DJ-for-hire looking to make the big time. Both are secret agents. And together they'll team up to take down a powerful baked goods cartel.\"\r\n\r\nThis one was inspired by John Perry's fanfic \"Mission: Implausible\", featuring everyone's favourite musician ponies as secret agents. Also an excuse for me to pretend to be Monty Norman and write a big band tune. The song turned out about 1000% funkier than I expected though. (Another bonus is I now know how to do dubstep-style wobble bass.)\r\n\r\nRead \"Mission: Implausible\" here: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/44000/mission-implausible\r\nCover art from Gen-Jack-Oneill: http://gen-jack-oneill.deviantart.com/art/We-re-Getting-the-Band-Back-Together-289408459\r\n\r\nJust a warning for my regular listeners: this is pretty different from what you've probably heard from me before, it's not metal, not even close!"

So I've concentrated on what I though was the best part of the season, musically, which was all the wonderful music from the finale.

Applejack loved skipping out on work and either sleeping, or walking around, in and out of town. She learns how to work hard for her family when she has to take care of others besides herself. I guess this also explains why the clubhouse was so rundown when Applejack gave it to the CMC: It was her former hideout to get away from work, but since Applebloom was born, had gone out of use and out of repair. Yey, I made headcanon~\r\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\r\nThis song will be featuring on the \"Cure for Kiki\" album, also featuring the talents of:\r\n\r\nTheLivingTombstone\r\nRina-chan\r\nBronyfied\r\nAssertive Fluttershy\r\nBaq5\r\nAnd many more!\r\n\r\nThis album is part of the \"Cure for Kiki Project\" headed by my friend Spencer Bevan.

        "description": "It had been nearly a year since the Alicorn Amulet incident when Twilight, on official business to outlying areas of Equestria, found Trixie alone and destitute.  Life had not been kind to the show-mare; time and time again, she had rebuilt her wagon and tried to resume performances, but word seemed to have spread.  In every town she had been met with at least as much avarice as she had at that fateful show, years ago in Ponyville.\r\n\r\nWhen Twilight Sparkle stumbled upon her, \u201cThe Great and Powerful Trixie\u201d was so broken inside, she didn't even have the energy to lash-out at the one she felt had been the beginning of her downfall.  A simple, lifeless \u201cHi\u201d was all she could manage.\r\n\r\nHowever, this one word, \u201cHi,\u201d had real magic within it... not magic to vanquish foes... not show-stopping magic... but rather the magic of friendship.\r\n\r\nSending Spike on to complete the rounds, Twilight stayed with Trixie; sharing her campfire and the tarp that had once been a resplendent proscenium.  \r\n\r\nTwilight helped Trixie to see that the magic Trixie herself possessed was not intended for the same purposes as her own \u2013 saving villages, empires and the like.  But even so, Trixie's gift for magic was in fact just as valuable; for it could be used to lift spirits and inspire hope.  Trixie's magic was the kind of magic that could entertain, surprise and enchant... woven well, it was the kind of magic that could encourage greatness _within_others._\r\n\r\nTwilight stayed with Trixie in the little clearing; listening, sharing, and helping Trixie to create a show that focused on bringing out the best in the pony volunteers from an audience.\r\n\r\nTrixie was secretly terrified to go in in front of another audience, but with Twilight's gentle encouragement, the first performance of this new act was the best Trixie could ever remember.  The hoofstomps and cheers as she took her last bow were positively thunderous.  And there was Twilight, her friend, right there in the front row beaming up at her with tears in her beautiful violet eyes.\r\n\r\nNow the campfire burns low next to the two friends asleep in the little clearing, and Trixie wakes from a pleasant dream....\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a dream I had\r\nof us in Ponyville...\r\nthings were different,\r\n'cause you cared for me still;\r\nlike you do right now.\r\n\r\nI wandered empty streets down\r\npast the shop-displays;\r\nI heard the clock-tower bell\r\nringing down the alleyway,\r\nas I walked on.\r\n\r\nAnd when you ran to me,\r\nyour coat damp with the night;\r\nwe  walked on frosted fields\r\nof juniper and lamplight.\r\n...You held my hoof.\r\n\r\nAnd when I awoke\r\nand felt you warm and near,\r\nI kissed your smoky mane\r\nwith my grateful tears.\r\nOh I love you, mare.\r\nOh I love you.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\u201cFor Twilight (Trixie's Song)\u201d - a parody of \u201cFor Emily\u201d by Simon and Garfunkel\r\nwords and vocals by Amadhia \u201cDreamsong\u201d\r\n\r\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, all canon characters, locations and their likenesses are (c) Hasbro.\r\nUsed for the intent of promoting the enjoyment of the animated series.\r\n\u201cFor Emily, Wherever I May Find Her\u201d MIDI sequenced by Michael D MacDonald"

FOLLOW HER TUMBLR NOW! http://askdragonfly.tumblr.com/ DO IT!\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly i feel like thsi should be a sub special\r\n\r\nBackstory of the song\r\nThis song is actually a few things. The first verse is actually about brony rappers that look down at what they do. It was me saying that no matter what it's about if you have the skill you have the skill. It's that simple. What you're doing maybe different or wierd but that just means it's unique!\r\nThe second verse and third verse's were both directed at me on the other hand. The second being about the performance i have coming up and how i'm actually nervous due to the content of what i'm performing. The third verse is asking myself what i'm gonna do about it. ending the verse by saying i'm going to live. \r\n\r\nThis is the song that is planned to end my set for my performance on the 27th so i felt the last verse i should try and get the audience involved as well! This is one of my favorite songs i've done amazing for fans of MLP and non!\r\n\r\nTo my fans (Or haters) thank you! You all made every verse i've ever rapped worth it! To my friends, you helped make this a AMAZING roller coaster that i had the chance to hop on. All the ups and downs that it's put us through, they were fun and we can look back at them and laugh! So where it takes me  or any of us may still be a mystery but i have a feeling that we're all gonna enjoy it. \r\n\r\nFinally to Orion! You and me HAVE to do another collab in the future! You're fucking amazing and without you this song wouldn't be NEAR as good as it is right now!\r\n\r\nFollow me at Twitter https://twitter.com/Versal17\r\n\r\nTumblr http://versal-chronic.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\nEQB https://eqbeats.org/user/340"

I remember seeing the episode it was in and just thinking that it's already close enough to rock, so what was I going to do with it? I'd end up with a song too close to the original.\r\n\r\nBut there are two major problems: 1) The song *really* catchy. (2) I suddenly had some interesting ideas about how to restructure the song to extend it, and for some vocal arrangements. I ended up with this; the first half of the song pretty much sticks to the original, than it goes off the deep end. So I think we can look at it this way: this song was less about changing the arrangement and the style of the song, and more about seeing how many vocal tracks you can pile on top of each other before it turns into pure cacophony.\r\n\r\nI might actually post a screencap of the vocal tracks on Tumblr, just for a laugh, so keep an eye on that. (Shameless plug? Me!? Never!)\r\n\r\nBig thanks go to Warbalist for playing lead guitar on the track and pretty much knocking it out of the park. Go check out his channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/warbalist)!\r\n\r\nHave a question? Check out my Tumblr at http://0netr1ckp0nymusic.tumblr.com/"

As this is the case, these lyrics are special to me, and though I may be skewing Gilda's personality to better fit a sympathetic song, I still think it's very fitting for a song about an old friend who you've parted with.\r\n\r\nI know your out there watching me, so when you read this, you know I'm talking to you. Once I'm at the top, I'm coming back to get you. I don't care if it takes me a year or ten, I'm going to work to get you back.\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\nPast a decade into the future, Gilda is looking back at events that had exiled her from Ponyville. Now famous and occupied, her mind still manages to remember the guilt that she felt as she was too prideful to apologize for acting mean. As she was reflecting on how her life had turned out, a blast of sound followed by a wave of rainbow that rattled the clouds around her. In a sudden epiphany, she realizes it's not too late to apologize. After a few moments of self triumph over her prideful limits, she heads on a journey all over the world, starting with Ponyville, to find her old friend and crew, to say sorry for breaking bonds.\r\n\r\nSidenote:\r\nThis, from Gilda's perspective, is an alternate timeline \"sequel\", set over a decade later, to AcousticBrony's and PrinceWhateverer's \"Breaking Bonds\", hence the +, credit to them for an awesome song and IBringDaLULZ for being the OG rapper.\r\n\r\n[11] Featured on Equestria Daily's \"Music of the Day #56\":\r\nhttp://www.equestriadaily.com/2013/01/filly-chrysalis.html\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sA9vT2oDlBBYMtLVPc6fjJuvvRUCZZBdXfPFuv5Y9bA/edit\r\n\r\nDownload:\r\nhttps://eqbeats.org/track/5227\r\n\r\nVizualizer by VizualizationBrony:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/VisualizationBrony\r\n\r\nArt by MxByte:\r\nhttp://mxbyte.deviantart.com/\r\n\r\nOriginal Breaking Bonds:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdFqu69VfUQ\r\n\r\nAcousticBrony's Channel:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AcousticBrony\r\n\r\nPrinceWhateverer's Channel:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/princewhateverer\r\n\r\nIBringDaLULZ Channel:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ibringdalulz\r\n\r\nOriginal song is Ke$ha's \"Dancing With Tears in My Eyes\".

I don't own the original, and this is merely a fan interpretation and stuff.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, hope you guys like."

It was so good, too!\r\n\r\nThe first song I ever released was \"Closet Brony\" (https://eqbeats.org/track/2235) and you guys welcomed me so warmly in the community. It was with that response that I decided to continue on and make more songs covering different random things. Many of them can be found at http://superdocisaac.tumblr.com/ but it all started with the Brony Community. You guys rocks. Thanks for having me around!\r\n\r\nIn my own way of saying thanks, I decided to veer off course from my usual nerdcore and do a cover of my favorite songs from the community, \"Luna\" by Eurobeat Brony. Yes, I'm singing this time around! I went a different path with it and wanted to give off a Darkwave/Cruxshadows tone with it, so I hope I succeeded with that. I kept fiddling with it on and off for a couple of months and finally decided that I needed to get the idea out in the open. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have making it!\r\n\r\nI'm leaving this as an Equestrian Beats original for a short time. Once again, thank you guys for everything! I plan on sticking around for quite a while!\r\n\r\nInterested in having me do vocals on your track? I'm game! Hit me up at sircrowbar@gmail.com and we'll work something out!"

Now that the CMC (err the \"Young Folks\") are outta the picture the two can take it a bit slower and get to know if it is a match. This works as a duet between the 2 characters and is really about unfolding a relationship. Fluttermac fans this may be post-breakup, who knows, it's just fannon. I also really wanted to do this song as Dreamsong and I are both older then most in the community (the other young folks), have been doing our own thing as well, and are spending lots of time not worrying about pony politics and just having fun making music. Thanks to her for the amazing vocals and for being such a wonderful friend. She did an amazing job on this and we're continuing to work together for out eventual album coming out in the near future.\r\n\r\nHer youtube is http://www.youtube.com/user/Amadhia and pony.fm is https://pony.fm/dreamsong Also know as Amadhia in case there is any confusion. Please visit and subscribe if you want to keep tabs on her upcoming music too."

However I'm going in with identifying with Lightning Dust's character a bit. Can recklessness be an admirable trait when it comes to music? If Rainbow Dash is playing by the rules to get into the Wonderbolts (ie Rainbow & Rooted) then I'm going the reckless route; taking some chances, taking a few u turns, and mixing some genres together. Will i make the team (err album) and be a wonderbolt too or be shown the door?\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually no. Didn't make it on the comp, lol, oh well.... Either way i had a fun time making this track and i hope you enjoy your flight... :)  "

I'm also in luck because http://mpa-art.tumblr.com/ did plenty of artwork too based on the plot and he gave his permission for the use of that for the pmv. \r\n\r\nI am so glad And The Rainfall (Don) introduced me to SylverLining as she was awesome on this track and has a hell of a voice. I look forward to hopefully working again with her soon. I gave her this track and she did a home run on the vocals.\r\nHer youtube is here http://www.youtube.com/user/SylverNuckelavee\r\nHer soundcloud is here https://soundcloud.com/sylverlining She'd love to do more metal vocals if anyone out there is looking for a vocalist (or other genres too frankly). Give her a shot and a sub if you like her."

One who gave her life to repair her homeland... To repair the wastelands. Though her trails were many and her foes were strong. She did it. She brung sunshines and rainbows to all...

What better way than by watching My Little Pony: Friendship is magic on Netflix!? And surprise, surprise, when the ponies burst into song: bronies are on the track! Let's hope Sunset Shimmer takes away a good lesson from the song. We all know Pinkie Pie's rapping didn't help Rainbow Dash with learning the Wonderbolt's history, but maybe this time me and my friends can help both Rainbow Dash and Sunset shimmer the magic of friendship, and what it means to be a brony on the track!\r\n\r\nDownload: https://eqbeats.org/track/8496\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlright~! First song of 2015! New year, new goals~ Specifically for me, 2016 subs by 2016!\r\nThats about a year to get around 900 subscribers, and doing the math\r\nThat's around 2-3 subs per day.\r\nSo, what does that mean for you? It means more hustle, more songs,\r\nMore content, and new things that I'll be trying out!\r\n\r\nShouts out to IAmSwagg007, and IAmRhymeFlow for starting this up,\r\nLightning Charger for doing a remix with me,\r\nAnd finally ClaviSound and Melody beats for this new one!\r\n\r\nThis song is, effectively:\r\nA remake with a collab of a remix of a collab of a remake\r\nWith a collab of IAmSwagg's remix of Like That, which is a collab.\r\n\r\n.-.\r\n\r\nEeyup.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there are any hip hop fans within the community,\r\nFeel free to ask for collabs or help with any of your tracks.\r\nWe definitely want to get Brony Rap back on the frontlines!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, enjoy, my little ponies :D\r\n\r\nAnimation, music video, subtitles, mixing and mastering by Buffalo Brony,\r\nVocals by Clavi Sound, Melody Beats, and Buffalo Brony.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to subscribe!\r\n\r\nClavi Sound's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ClaviSound\r\n\r\nMelody Beat's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJeekQkP_oDa4O3U_cKwOGg\r\n\r\nBuffalo Brony's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/BuffaloBrony"

Each will have her own song.\r\n\r\n   As for this particular one, I based the Idea behind this song on Rarity questioning her fabulousity and beauty.

Not a bad personality.\r\n\r\nIn his strength was a weak link. \r\nCause when you rise in the ranks your's the prize other's teeth sink. \r\n\r\nOther guys see the meat, think \r\nUse lies and other wily devices like a heat seek\r\n\r\nballistic. Sick and sadistic\r\nYou're instincts get flipped, and then you missed it. \r\n\r\nAnd this is the abyss, that the rumor mill built.\r\nAnd the life that you had, all the lies still killed.\r\n\r\nFull tilt, you swell with ill guilt.\r\nCause the misstep you felt, trippin on full stilts.  \r\n\r\nAnd it's fulfilled your fail has peeled all your layers.\r\nThe will of the grapevine, sealed by the haters.\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\nDivine is the vine when it finds you. \r\nLies that'll strangle and bind as it ties you. \r\n\r\nIf you hide or you try to \r\nFly from the site, it's the lies that rise up behind you.\r\n\r\nNo Escape from the Grape Vine, it'll take sinners and saints \r\nFrom the Insane to the Great Minds. \r\n\r\nonly remedy is take time.  \r\nEven the holy and the wise are unsafe from the fake lie.\r\n\r\n(Verse 2)\r\n\r\nA seed planted will breed man into deep havoc\r\nThey'll need packets of Xanax so they can breathe dammit.\r\n\r\nAnd these habits will bleed men into weak addicts\r\nAt least that'll completely make the beef static. \r\n\r\nOnce he's had it, the peace vanishes, he's damaged. \r\nCause he's saddened by these events, grief, panic. \r\n\r\nBelief wavers and trusts shatters, his heart seizes. \r\nThe Winter thrust on his soul, solely a dark season. \r\n\r\nA hard reason, but seriously, a rumor does it. \r\nConsumes your body like tumor in your mind's oven. \r\n\r\nThe size of it can double when lies touch it.\r\nAnd as such, despise fills ya eyes than ya plummet. \r\n\r\nAnd you never really recover, the scars ever present \r\nResenting any mention of it. It's never endin' \r\n\r\nAnd eventu-ly everybody you ever even knew \r\nWill be poisoned by lie and will never believe you. \r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\r\n(Verse 3)\r\n\r\nTick tock the sands of time drain.\r\nAnd you're locked in the guilt of the rumor mind game.\r\n\r\nYour life decimated to a fraction. \r\nyour past jaded with vile hated reactions.\r\n\r\nInaction in a sedentary state. \r\nAgoraphobic tendencies tend to activate \r\n\r\nAnd it's fascinating > seeing a man once great\r\nReduced to a pitiful mass, a numb state. \r\n\r\nBut it doesn't last forever, you die or you grow. \r\nGet your ass together, or quit the live show.\r\n\r\nEven I know, a man of your caliber, can pull\r\nand put 9 mills up against your temple. \r\n\r\nSuccessfully... end your life...so fast. \r\nOr you can man up, and admit you might last.\r\n\r\nAnd you can move forward with the scars of the past.\r\nBut no man is safe from the Rumor Mill's Grasp."

I jumped out of bed, and jotted it down while downloading the stems. All in all, I think the tune came together well.\r\n\r\nI used a different cover art from the original, since the original just doesn't suit how the tune comes off to me. It's an uplifting piece, if a bit wistful. I like to think the narrator's entreaties were heard, and the dust was blown off the old friendship in the end. The original cover art doesn't really convey that at all."

Basically For a while I've wanted to do a song about Project Horizon... and then the last chapter came out. Before I say this let me tell you, Project Horizon is FUCKING AMAZING but dark as FUCK! Like you do not understand. This thing will take your heart and rip it into 2. Ask anyone who has EVER read it. But anyway, the character Lacunae kinda died in the chapter so I got to work on this like not even a hour after reading the chapter. I dont personally think this is all that great lyrically, but what ev. I hope you enjoy this and if Somber was ever to hear this then my life would be complete (Hint Hint)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Versal17\r\nTumblr http://versal-chronic.tumblr.com/\r\nEQB https://eqbeats.org/user/340"

I found the vocals from a remix pack with the stems from Silva Hound's song \"Hooves Up High (ft.

I actually deleated the othor stems. Anyway, if you think I should change that let me know.\r\n\r\nI worked pretty hard on this one, so let me know what you think I did good at and what I could do better.

Lore's been a great friend to me so I hope this energetic mix of Darkwave and Trance is just a small gesture of how much i appreciate both his music and his friendship. \r\n\r\nLore's Original is here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeqSF6FjgHw\r\n\r\nKankitsuru for the opening/closing image\r\nhttp://kankitsuru.deviantart.com/art/Forgive-me-Sister-346380454\r\n\r\nLore's Original is here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeqSF6FjgHw"

I really enjoyed Sim's solo piano track and i thought Vinyl Scratch could answer right back to Fredrick's superiority taunt with a remix bringing it back into her world of EDM but absorbing the original piano elements. This track came together quickly and w/o anywhere near the complications of another i was working on so glad for the unusual quick turnaround. I hope you and Sim enjoy it!!

It came into focus when I thought about Sweetie Bot from Friendship is Witchcraft. The struggle to find an emotional identity within an artificial mind that Sweetie Bot has throughout the series is conducive, IMO, to the futurist ethos of techno, and I feel like if a machine were to make a song dedicated to her adopted sister, this is pretty darn close to what it would sound like.\r\n-------------------------------\r\nArtwork by: BrainSucks\r\nhttp://brainsucks.deviantart.com/art/MLP-fim-Sweetie-Bot-352581554\r\nWatch Friendship is Witchcraft (No, seriously, watch it):\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbr-HVHOIZZvehxQw0vO4Hq_VEcbDHez7\r\nAnd check out the Sherclop Ponies website:\r\nhttp://sherclop.com/\r\n-------------------------------\r\nLyrics\r\nIf you weren't there for me,\r\nHow would I feel alive?\r\nSince I am your sister,\r\nCan this unit feel love?"

Claimed he had someone murdered in retaliation once. Died of a suspicious drug overdose that was probably foul play. Owed me money, sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Gumby\" was a mellow drug addict/junkie type. Overdosed on methadone in a seedy motel.\r\n\r\ntracklist is as follows:\r\n\r\n#1 - Me recording via portable DAT machine in another friend's car when we pick up Rocco, who just successfully fled the cops after they busted a party. He forces me to shut off the machine by threatening to break it, which he totally would have.\r\n\r\n#2 - Rocco spitting this one rap he wrote years ago. It was always dope, but he could never get it to flow on a beat, and he never really wrote anything else.\r\n\r\n#3 - Gumby freestyling over Eminem \"Role Model\" on MY FIRST STUDIO SETUP\u2122 (Acid Pro w00t, my dad made me a female XLR to male 1/8th headphone adapter, and we'd plug that bitch right into the back of the computer and go to work. ghetto as fuck). He was so high on Xanax pills that he actually nodded off several times while recording this. I was afraid he was gonna overdose right then and there tbh. Like don't die in my fucking house dude. Eh, he was more like an acquaintance anyway.\""

I worked with the lovely and talented: Moon Shines (http://www.youtube.com/user/musicbymoonshine) \r\n\r\nShe wanted to Ponify Alicia Key's \"Un-Thinkable\" with a little Discord/Celestia shipping. \r\nI'm not one to turn down a concept, so I thought, LET'S DO DIS!\r\n\r\nWe were originally going to sing/duet together on a different song, but she decided my voice was better suited for rapping! (A very wise decision :P) \r\n\r\nSo if you have a special someone you want to do Un-thinkable things with... YOU DO IT!  *Be Un-Thinkable Responsibly.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I haven't been able to record since NOVEMBER 2013, but I'm happy to let you know that all changes NEXT MONDAY!  I'll be back in the lab, writing and recording and cranking out much more music for you all!  \r\n\r\nI'm going to BabsCon (http://www.babscon.com/) with IbeConcept (http://www.youtube.com/user/ibeabronyrapper?feature=watch) in April, so if you're in the area, say hi!  I might actually get to have my own set!  \r\n\r\nStay tuned for updates for me possibly going to a Midwest Con and... BronyCon 2014? \r\n\r\nThanks to all of you for sticking around during my very dry spell.

My metal take on \"This Day Aria\".\r\n\r\nStraight-up metal, as usual. As HurricaneSparky noted, most metal covers/remixes of this source go the symphonic route, so I definitely wanted to keep this one different in that regard. It took quite a while getting all of those tempo changes ironed out, too. And how many covers out there implement Part 2? That's just screaming for the heavy. I also characterized the music according to who's singing, with Chrissy's parts being a bit darker and heavier, and Cadance's sections being a bit more upbeat."

More than anything, it simply revealed that yes, she actually has the capacity to apologize for her wrongdoing. Nevermind the fact that she really had nothing to apologize for in Boast Busters. Trixie still seems mortified at the suggestion that someone might actually get to know the version of her that isn't an act, as evidenced by her recession into third person self-reference and her hasty exit at the end. I hope someday, the writers put her into a position where she is forced to get to know somepony, and learns that really, it's not so bad as she's built it up to be in her mind.\r\n\r\nCover Art: Oh the Places You Will See, by ThePleonasticPotato\r\nhttp://thepleonasticpotato.deviantart.com/art/Oh-The-Places-You-Will-See-360520609?q=gallery%3AThePleonasticPotato&qo=3\r\n\r\nSamples From: http://www.mlptf2mods.com/create/reference-materials"

        "description": "And here we go, with my first ever original MLP-inspired song! =D\r\n\r\nFor this song, I envisioned a Pegasi, who perhaps met a Water Pony from beneath the ocean, who is very sad and lonely. This song is that Pegasi's words to the lonely water pony, to come out of the water that traps her, and see the world from above the waves...\r\n\r\nThe idea for this story originally came from proof-reading a brilliant novel-in-progress by a good friend of mine named Aquatic-Angel (http://aquatic-angel.deviantart.com), so she is just as much to thank for the inspiration as well =)\r\n\r\nAlso, special thanks to Almost Anyone for producing such a wonderful track to put these lyrics too, your a champ!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMusic by Almost Anyone\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AlexReadeMusic\r\n\r\nLyrics and Vocals by Fritzybeat\r\n\r\nInstrumental:\r\nhttp://almostanyone.bandcamp.com/track/oxygen\r\n\r\nVocals:\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/kt6cy6525l71c21/Oxygen_Vocals.m4a\r\n\r\nDownload: (MP4)\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/q2kdx7hhh0kd5y2/Oxygen.m4a\r\n\r\nWatch on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_AYXdVovfs\r\n\r\nListen on Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/fritzybeat/oxygen-fritzybeat-almost-1\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFeatured on Equestria Daily: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2013/11/spotlight-music-oxygen-froggy-bottom.html\r\n\r\nFeatured on Everypony Sings: http://www.everyponysings.com/2013/11/original-oxygen.html\r\n\r\nFeatured on Scottish Bronies: http://www.scottishbronies.co.uk/1/post/2013/11/music-share-8.html\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nLike a dazzling pearl hidden in the darkest night\r\nYour beauty will not shine till' you're in the light\r\nSo open up your oyster of sorrow and pain\r\nAnd let it all be washed away\r\n\r\nThere's a world above the ocean floor\r\nSo just take my hand, and I'll show you more\r\nSo come up here, oh come up here\r\nThere's a world for you to explore, just breath the atmosphere\r\n\r\nYour heart like paper your eyes like broken glass\r\nWhy are you so dragged down by what comes to pass?\r\nLife can be dark hard times are bound to come\r\nBut we can't let this anchor hold us to the ground\r\n\r\nThere's a world above the ocean floor\r\nSo just take my hand, and I'll show you more\r\nSo come up here, oh come up here\r\nThere's a world for you to explore, just breath the atmosphere\r\n\r\nSo come up here, oh come up here\r\nThere's a world for you to explore, just breath the atmosphere\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHope you like!\r\n\r\n~Fritzy"

        "description": "I thought it would be cool to do a blues / country song (not too many brony versions of that) and make it about Cranky and Pinkie's meeting up. I know a lot of people give Pinkie crap for her tenacity in that episode and initially upsetting him as much helping him. I think its important to remember just how beaten down his character was when he arrived and how she brought some new found joy back to his life. Anyway i really identify with some of the themes with this one so it was fun writing the lyrics. More importantly doing a duet with Sylverlining was wonderful as she's just so talented and having a youthful and fresh approach to music has made me a little less cranky and withered myself. I hope you enjoy this change of pace. :D\r\n\r\nHer channel is always http://www.youtube.com/user/SylverNuckelavee and we'll be doing further work together (currently working on the Maressey album). She's fabulous so please show her some support too!"

        "description": "It's unfortunate that Rainbow Factory is a massively well known song & fimfiction and yet there's been no musical adaption of the wonderfully written and yet terribly scary and grotesque Cheerilee's Garden (arguably one of the best of the grimdark bunch and the MLP equivalent of a Saw or Hostel). So here is a track i put together about the fimfic and with the help of my local friend Mathematicus (bridge guitar, advice, and many other elements). It's definitely not for the young kiddies (and you can push the button and elect for the non-pmv) but hopefully perfect for Nightmare Night and for those who don't mind a bit of scarier fare.\r\n\r\nThe fimfic is here (and again its a good scary and gory read) http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1766/\r\n\r\nArt thumbnail is by the departed swaetshrit http://swaetshrit.deviantart.com/ who sadly is no longer active.\r\nDemotivational (split sides of cheerilee is from) SkiddleZIzKewl\r\nhttp://skiddlezizkewl.deviantart.com/art/Cheerilee-s-Garden-352841348\r\nAnd everything else was screenshot and cropped from the show itself.\r\n\r\nI'll likely be getting stems up soon if anyone wants a crack at remixing this in a different style. If there's enough interest I'll release an ep of remixes in a month or so (already have a thrash metal version partway done that will be out with that). So keep in touch. :D\r\n\r\nMathematicus is here http://www.youtube.com/user/z4k4t4k and he's actually working on his own grimdark album of the mane 6 based on the ask blogs and they're worth staying tuned for. Please check him out and subscribe if that's at all interesting to you!"

        "description": "So this first and foremost is a ponified cover of R.E.M.'s - Man on the Moon, which is a classic song on its own. While having a year w/o ponies was rough there have been amazing developments in the comics but not a whole lot of fan music to reflect those adventures. So this song loosely chronicles the plotlines of #5-8 but also examines skepticism in the fandom. If we examine MLP too closely under the microscope or presume that it's drying out we'll end up damaging the very thing we hopefully still love.\r\n\r\nI have all the lyrics originally posted here on my tumblr (plz do read them and subscribe if you want to keep tabs on what's upcoming or what i release)HERE\r\n\r\nI do encourage people to support the comics as they are more ambitious then most of the single and many of the 2 parter episodes and have amazing art and wonderful storylines. I wanted to use the art as a teaser. After all pmv's use the show and you don't see movies w/o trailers. I did try to avoid a complete plot givewaway. ;)\r\n\r\nFree mp3 here https://soundcloud.com/dj-p0n-3/freewave-sylverlinging-mare-on\r\nand here https://pony.fm/tracks/1697-freewave-sylverlining-mare-on-the-moon\r\n\r\nA massive thanks to Sylverlining for her amazing vocal talents and helping me out on the choruses. https://www.youtube.com/user/SylverNuckelavee  She's amazing and you should keep tabs on her.\r\n"

So i haven't been able to work on anything new for a long time so i thought i'd atleast upload this for you guys. \r\nAn interesting mix when i first did it.

        "description": "Sorry for taking so long to upload this here, but for some reason EqBeats wouldn't accept the format =/ Silly silly EqBeats =P\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIONS! 8D\r\n\r\nThe moment I joined the fandom, one of the first brony songs I heard was L-Train's cover of the song \"Cerulean Blue\", which of course led me to discover the epicness of the original song by Replacer, and while I think L-Train had the right idea in speeding the track up, I felt the rockiness of the track sort of caused it to loose its more emotional side, the happiness of the original if you will. \r\nI wanted to create something that captured the best of both worlds, something that both gave the feeling of tranquility in flight, and the velocity of flight with Rainbow Dash. This was the result.\r\n\r\nFun fact: this track was originally an old scrapped track Almost Anyone just sort of threw aside for future projects, and I decided such a work of art should never go to waste, so I repurposed it =D\r\n\r\nHope you all Enjoy, and again, thank you to Almost Anyone for his amazing music skills, and another special thank you to L-Train for the inspiration to create this song X3\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCheck out the original Cerulean Blue here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSThrDFhoHM\r\n\r\nMusic by Almost Anyone\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AlexReadeMusic\r\n\r\nLyrics by the amazing Replacer:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/dominian42?feature=watch\r\n\r\nVocals and additional mixing by Fritzybeat\r\n\r\nCover Art by my good friend Ziggyfin: http://ziggyfin.deviantart.com\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstrumental:\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/sdrai58p246pau8/Cerulean+Blue+%28Instrumental%29.mp3\r\n\r\nVocals:\r\n-(Coming Soon!)-\r\n\r\nDownload M4A:\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/h5wal6ppz5zopwq/Cerulean+Blue.m4a\r\nDownload MP3:\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/4l8d2cltryqhn0t/Cerulean+Blue.mp3\r\n\r\nListen on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOHZzRx65PE\r\n\r\nListen on Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/fritzybeat/cerulean-blue-fritzybeat\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFeatured on Equestria Daily: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2013/12/music-of-day-228.html\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nA flash of colour and she's gone, no one can hope to pursue\r\nA flank of red and white and yellow and cerulean blue\r\nAnd making rainbows awesome since october two thousand ten\r\nAnother day, a rush of wind and she'll be at it again\r\nThose airborne virtuosics are the stuff of legends and more\r\nThe name is Rainbow Dash and I suspect you've heard it before\r\nNow if you come with me you'll find her where she takes her repose\r\nYou won't forget her quickly once you see her as she well knows\r\n\r\nIf ever you're in need of help she will show up with a smile\r\nAnd indescribable velocity, impeccable style\r\nAgility in spades and pegasine charisma to match\r\nAnd when you're falling you can count on her to be there to catch\r\nDon't be alarmed if she does not appear as soon as you shout\r\nYou know she probably just stopped to give some autographs out\r\nTo call her narcissistic is an understatement and yet\r\nShe's just that good, it's not surprising that it goes to her head\r\n\r\nRainbow Dash is best pony\r\nWhen the world seems everfree\r\nColoured winds blow through my mind\r\nEverything is left behind\r\n\r\nFly, Rainbow Dash, Fly...\r\n\r\nNow Rainbow Dash, I think you could do worse than listening to me\r\nThough you're spectacular it's probable your friends would agree\r\nYour self-aggrandising demeanour is ungracious and cruel\r\nAs if you're insecure and compensating, don't be a fool\r\nYou know you'll never be a Wonderbolt until you admit\r\nYou need to lift your game and act as if you really want it\r\nStill busy napping when you could be out perfecting your art\r\nSo much potential, come on Rainbow Dash, you're breaking my heart\r\n\r\nRainbow Dash is best pony\r\nWhen the world seems everfree\r\nColoured winds blow through my mind\r\nEverything is left behind\r\n\r\nFly, Rainbow Dash, Fly...\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHope you like!\r\n\r\n~Fritzy"

        "description": "Youtube Link: http://youtu.be/pizCeB7EIQM\r\n\r\nHappy \"Day after 4th of July\" or as the NON U.S. world calls it... 'July 5th'. \r\n\r\nBelieve it or not it's been a DISTURBING 5 months since last I put something on my channel.  I have a horrible knack of NOT releasing music on months that I do performances and so 2 of those 5 months were JUST that.  \r\n\r\nIn April I was at BABScon in San Francisco, CA\r\nhttp://youtu.be/BZDZUprqIPs\r\n\r\nAnd June I performed at Club Luna in Anaheim, CA. \r\nhttp://youtu.be/Tvw06vvD_y8\r\n\r\nAt the end of this month, i'll be crashing BronyCon 2014 AGAIN, so... I'm hoping to 'buck the trend' with this Release/Contest.\r\n\r\nWhat is it?  I worked with a friend of mine, Sooshie Shef over 2 years ago with an idea to release a 'Berry Punch'-centric track.  But back then I didn't have the same recording setup as I do now, and he eventually wandered off to do important things like focus on school.  Now that I've found the track, I decided not ONLY to release it, but I thought it would be in good fun to create a contest out of it.\r\n\r\nThe contest goes out to all Music Producers/DJ's/People that Make za Musicks for the fun of it.  The challenge?  Put together a 'Dirty South' instrumental remix of this 'Berry Punch Drunk' track.  Rules are as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Dirty South Style Beat \r\n2. Must use my 'Berry Punch Drunk' A Capella \r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rhymeflow/berry-punch-drunk-flowny-acapella/s-vPpVd\r\n3. E-mail me an MP3 Mixdown at I.Am.Rhyme.Flow@gmail.com\r\n4. Send it in at a 256kpbs quality or higher, but no 'WAV' files please!\r\n5. Have it in my mailbox no later than 11:59pm on July 25th 2014.\r\n\r\nThe winner will be announced VIA Twitter @RhymeFlow1 on July 30th 2014 \r\n\r\nThe track will be selected with the assistance of myself and a handful of judges who I think will help me make the best decision.\r\n\r\nThe winner will work with me to put together a 'Final Contest Winner' release of 'Berry Punch Drunk' which includes new recorded vocals, a possible fan VA of Berry Punch doing the chorus, a shiny Lyric Video with jazzy audio/visual effects, shameless promotion of the track on all my Social Media outlets, an opportunity to have a Priority Collaboration with yours truly (oh yeah, big whoop), and if you're AT BronyCon 2014 this year, I will personally buy you a beverage.  (Alcoholic if you're of legal age, and non... if you're... not.) \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the track, and I especially hope I can see some of you AT BronyCon! If you're there, catch Flows & Cons at BronyPalooza and don't forget to swing by and say hi! \r\n\r\nTL:DR - I have a contest to remix THIS song, and I'll be at BronyCon 2014! \r\n\r\n~ Rhyme Flow\r\n\r\nPS - Toga Berry Punch Art by NicholasNSane \r\nhttp://fav.me/d4l9kra"

What's gotten into me?\r\n\r\nHere's a theme for the timberwolves of the Everfree Forest, as it would be if MLP were a NES game.  I always thought they were pretty cool creatures, and the Apple family related episode this week reminded me of them from season 2.  Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nI loooooove 8-bit/chiptune music, mostly probably because I grew up playing the original NES and Atari, as well as old skool computer games.  I'd never really tried to make any of my own though, so I took up the challenge and hammered this out in Famitracker over the past day or so.  It was really interesting to see what problems the video game composers of that day had to overcome with hardware limitations.  If people are really interested, I may consider doing a real recording version of this, since I did come up with most of it on guitar anyway.  Let me know if you want that to happen, and I'll see what I can do when I get some more free time.\r\n\r\nLeafRunner - Composition, Programming\r\n\r\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is \u00a9Hasbro and The Hub."

I don't even know anymore XD\r\n\r\nAnyways, here's my \"remiovermashrody\" of BlackGryph0n and Baasik's brilliant song Faster Than You Know. Essentially how this started, was my brother brought up that a few people were talking about how similar Faster Than You Know was to a song called \"Gold\" by Owl City. I never saw the similarities musically, but lyrically, the two songs fit together like hoof in horseshoe X3\r\n\r\nSo, me being a big fan of Owl City, Baasik AND Gabe, I decided to create this bit of music :3 I didn't want to just sing overtop of the original Gold Instrumental though, so I dug up an older mix my pal Almost Anyone made of the song, and used that instead :3\r\n\r\nAnd yes Gabe, I KNOW you are probably really tired of these songs being compared to one another, but you MUST know this had to be done at some point XD \r\n\r\nI HAVE NO REGREEEEEEETS...! *shot*\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCheck out the original \"Faster Than You Know\" here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJg9114bgs\r\n\r\nCheck out the original \"Gold\" Here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H-IA_D3lqY\r\n\r\nMusic by Almost Anyone:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AlexReadeMusic\r\n\r\nVocals & Mixing by Fritzybeat (Thats meeeeeeeee)\r\n\r\nInstrumental:\r\n-link coming soon-\r\n\r\nVocals:\r\n-link coming soon-\r\n\r\nListen on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubzt79VYdGw\r\n\r\nListen on Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/fritzybeat/faster-than-you-know-fritzys\r\n\r\nOriginal video art by Mayocat: \r\nhttp://mayocat.deviantart.com\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nA hundred thousand stories have filled my head\r\nAs I look for the answers in what I've read\r\nSecretly waiting for my life to change\r\nAnd with this transformation, something's strange\r\n\r\nNow my world is bigger than I know\r\nI'm losing all control\r\nI never thought I'd make it...\r\n\r\nNow I know\r\nThis world spins faster than you know\r\nAnd I'd give anything to show what I'm trying for\r\nJust what I'm fighting for, oh...\r\nThis world spins faster than you know\r\nThis world spins faster than you know...\r\n\r\nEvery single heartbeat is something new\r\nAnd now that I'm immortal, what will I do?\r\nSomehow my wings are a symbol of a bigger change\r\nBut still a thousand questions fill my veins.\r\n\r\nCause this world is bigger than I know\r\nI'm losing all control \r\nI never thought I'd make it...\r\n\r\nNow I know\r\nThis world spins faster than you know\r\nAnd I'd give anything to show what I'm trying for\r\nJust what I'm fighting for, oh...\r\nThis world spins faster than you know\r\nThis world spins faster than you know...\r\n\r\nAnd in a hundred years will I still be the same?\r\nWill I outlive the ones who know my name?\r\nCan I let go of my eternal burning flame?\r\nWithout shame?\r\nWithout pain?\r\nAll the same,\r\nWho's to blame?\r\n\r\nAnd in a thousand years will I be all alone?\r\nWill this still be the place that I call home?\r\nAnd will I settle down, or will I start to roam\r\nFar from home?\r\nTime has shown\r\nWhat I've known\r\nTurned to stone...\r\n\r\nCause this world is bigger than I know\r\nI'm losing all control \r\nI never thought I'd make it...\r\n\r\nNow I know\r\nThis world spins faster than you know\r\nAnd I'd give anything to show what I'm fighting for\r\nJust what I'm dying for, oh...\r\nThis world spins faster than you know\r\nThis world spins faster than you know...\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHope you like!\r\n\r\n~Fritzy"

To point some settings up a little, I composed pieces of music for them.\r\n\r\nAbout the scenario: Because of a virus all ponies start losing their powers - magic, physical strength, the ability to fly. Medicating already born ponies is impossible, and over time the ponies got unable to find the virus' origin. Because of that Celestia restarts a project she had cancelled years ago on moral grounds: cloned ponies growing into adults within a few weeks and then aging normally. They are supposed to rescue Equestria from going down."

But I hope you like it anyway =)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMusic by Orca Flights:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/OrcaFlights/videos\r\n\r\nLyrics by Lewanut:\r\nhttp://lewanut.deviantart.com\r\n\r\nVocals, lyrical arrangement, & mixing by FritzyBeat (meeeeeeeee)\r\n\r\nInstrumental:\r\n-link coming soon-\r\n\r\nVocals:\r\n-link coming soon-\r\n\r\nListen on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/fritzybeat/waltzing-with-an-angel\r\n\r\nListen on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX3-B1nDX9k\r\n\r\nVideo art by FritzyBeat (me agaaaaaaaain)\r\n\r\nBackground photograph by RobertRobledo:\r\nhttp://robertrobledo.deviantart.com\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\nMirror to the past, I sit here reflecting\r\nOur introduction's where I'm introspecting\r\nParalyzed princess like a bedtime story\r\nI didn't know just what lay before me\r\n\r\nWasted no seconds, impromptu paramedic\r\nCouldn't just wait in the crowd that collected\r\nLet a breath out when I got you breathing\r\nFelt my heart skip while your heart kept beating\r\n\r\nRoadside island in a sea of masses\r\nWoken to life blinking through your glasses\r\nFraming your eyes like they're Renaissance paintings\r\nMeeting you lead to my reformation\r\n\r\nChance that we met it's a sweet irony\r\nAfter it all it was you who saved me\r\n\r\nUnder the stars with our hands intertwined\r\nOur futures ahead at the front of our minds\r\nPredilections so unprecedented\r\nFixed on your love see the future mended\r\n\r\nLike Nephilim, angels mingle with men\r\nIt's said angels dance on the point of a pin\r\nWe're a pinspeck in the cosmic hanger\r\nA pinhead, waltzing with an angel\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHope you like!\r\n\r\n~Fritzy"

The piece of music has four parts, while the ending just refers to the beginning. First the string section starts off with melancholic harmonies, then a lonely flute plays a melody that reflects all the suffering caused by corruption and war. The first part permanently rises to a beseeching exclaimation, just before the world of Luna Republik shows an other side: the war and the omnipresent fear. Not many words are necessary to express the horror, but instead there is a change again... maybe there is something positive left?\r\nA secluded melody draws a different image of this world, even though the apparent idyll in the middle of chaos does not survive long before being overtaken by suffering and the piece slowly vanishing into silence..."

Using the Techno Demo song from Alexander Gross's Xewton Music Studio, I created a song that responds to Fluttershy's initial negligence to let the Breezies go home.\r\n\r\nThis is my first full attempt at this compo. I was forced to use Adobe Audition as I currently have no Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). I will also note that I am not the best singer, but I got as close as I could. The voice effects are supposed to sound similar to that from Glaze/WoodenToaster's Rainbow Factory.\r\n\r\nIf this mix becomes a winner for this week's response, I will be sure to post it on my SoundCloud and YouTube, with improved audio. Simply search \"Midimistro\"  (with quotes) to find me elsewhere online.\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\nGot to get them home, get the breezies home, get the breezies home.\r\nGot to get them home, get the breezies home, get the breezies home.\r\n\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\n\r\n\r\nGot to get them home, get the breezies home, get the breezies home.\r\nGot to get them home, get the breezies home, get the breezies home.\r\n\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\n\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\n(Got to get them home, get the breezies home, get the breezies home.)\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\n(Got to get them home, get the breezies home, get the breezies home.)\r\nFluttershy, get the home, get them home, where they belong.\r\n"

Medicating already born ponies is impossible, and over time the ponies got unable to find the virus' origin. Because of that Celestia restarts a project she had cancelled years ago on moral grounds: cloned ponies growing into adults within a few weeks and then aging normally. They are supposed to rescue Equestria from going down."

It's been quite awhile since I had the chance to plug up my electric guitar to the amp and crank it up pretty loud, and now that I got a bit more space in my basement to set up a somewhat permanent space for a studio, I jumped on the chance to do so.  I hadn't really done a Rainbow Dash song before, sounded like the best opportunity to.  It sure would be pretty awesome to be able to just zoom around the sky, sounds like a lot of fun to me.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks and shoutout to my cousin for helping me record some parts of this and doing most of the mixing and production on this!  And too my uncle as well for letting my play and borrow his Taylor acoustic, as well as break in his two brand new mics!  I definitely want me a Taylor now...\r\n\r\nDoing my best to keep inspired, keep working on my arts, animation, and music.  Hearing all your lovely comments definitely helps to keep that going, you guys are all amazing!  Thanks so much as always for listening, liking, commenting, subscribing.  It still blows my mind that so many people dig my music.  Much love to you all!  Will try to see you again soon with more!\r\n\r\nGuitars, bass, and piano performed by: LeafRunner\r\nMixing by Jesse Finney\r\n\r\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is \u00a9Hasbro and The Hub."

My newest album now contains 2 tracks, and is nowhere near done yet =P, but I promise to have it done as soon as I can. \r\n\r\nAnyways, decided to go back to my old habit of just going with the flow of the song again, since I seem to do better that way. I also manage to get the song done a little faster too, for the fact that I save time attempting to follow a set style to the song, which in turn gives me more time to focus on mastering and editing the track. Also doing things this way is how I made Magic of Harmony, which is now also my most popular song on youtube.\r\n\r\nAs always I hope you enjoy the track, and keep tuned in if you want to hear more ^.^"

The point is that I'm dropping ANY Electronic project I had in the workings including my next album, Pride and Flame and the CMC EP, although I may make some trance-like song for the 3 of them for that one instead.\r\n\r\nNow then, this track I went to capture an image of aomeone gazing up at a starry sky with wonder and awe,and in the end this song came out simply beautifully ^^. Most likely, I'll start working on a Trance style album now, so look forward to more songs like this from now on, Trance songs are just so artistic and beautiful as well as a joy to make, no other style I've done makes me feel quite as proud of it as this song does, so I hope you all enjoy!"

It's strange; for humans, hallucinations are widely regarded as invalid experiences, since they are only experienced by one individual at a time, even if they are clearly valid to the individual. In the world of MLP, they've got incontrovertible proof of magic, so to suggest that a potion can make one see the past, even though nopony else can see it, just isn't that incredible. It's really downright mundane.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nShoutouts to Freewave, for being a bro and giving me a second opinion on the mix.\r\nThanks to mlptf2mods, as always, for being dears and providing great show samples.\r\nThanks to the people who make MLP, and make all this possible."

Also I know the piano sounds off, I must have slipped on a knob or something because there is a big chunk of the mid section taken out. lol silly me\r\n\r\nSorry I haven't uploaded any new songs in a while.

Remixed using Alexander Gross' Music Studio 2.5 for iOS. Rebalanced, remastered, and finalized using Adobe Audition.\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\nIt isn't that I'm ungreatful for al the things I have earned, for all the journies I have taken, for all the lessons that I have learned.\r\nBut I wonder where I am going now, what my role is meant to be. I don't know how to travel to a furture that I can't see.\r\n\r\nI have my wings, I wear this crown, I'm a princess, this is true. But it's still unclear to me, just what I am meant to do. I want to have a purpose, want to do all that I can. I want to make a contribution, I want to be a part of the plan. \r\n\r\nYour destiny's uncertain, and that's sometimes hard to take. But it will become much clearer, with every new choice you make.\r\n\r\nPatience is never easy. I understand wanting more. I know how hard it is to wait, to spread out your wings and soar. \r\n\r\nBut you stand here for a reason: Your gifted and you are strong. That crown is upon your head because you belong.\r\n\r\nKnow that your time is coming soon. As the sun rises, so does the moon. As love finds a place in every heart, you are a princess, you'll play your part.\r\n\r\nWe understand you wanting more. A chance to shine, a chance to soar.\r\n\r\nSoon will come the day it turns around.\r\n\r\nKnow that your time is coming soon. As the sun rises, so does the moon. As love finds a place in every heart, you are a princess, you'll play your part.\r\n\r\nKnow that your time is coming soon. As the sun rises, so does the moon.

Musically, it is perfect for Luna, and I was absolutely thrilled that it reprised as her motif in For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils. I felt that it would always make a good progression for some dusky Melodic Trance.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nArtwork by Matrosha123:\r\nhttp://matrosha123.deviantart.com/art/Her-beautiful-night-361043292?q=gallery%3Amatrosha123%2F39603665&qo=25\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThanks to mlptf2mods for the samples, as always.\r\nThanks to William Anderson, for writing wonderful background music. Make sure you take some time to go listen to the show's background music every now and then. Anderson doesn't get enough credit.\r\nAnd Thanks, finally, to everyone who makes MLP.

Sounds of serenity, of the open meadow billowing softly, disturbed ever so slightly by a small group of ponies, sprinting through happily, the infinitely liberating feelings of freedom flowing through each of them, enjoying companionship without the slightest care for any of the bad in the world.  There's something about ponies just running freely over the hills and through the valleys, that lull me into an unprecedented state of tranquility, something I kept in mind when I made this track."

It's a harsh and dissonant piece that conveys the conflict and anguish in Celestia's mind as she banishes her beloved sister turned Nightmare Moon to the moon.\r\n\r\nDarkness - 0:00\r\nThe Piece starts out with harsh chords to show the anger and jealousy coursing through Luna as she refuses to lower the moon and turns into Nightmare Moon. It continues into an a minor melodic line to represent the sorrow and fear in the ponies while retaining dissonance in the underlying chords to convey a feeling of darkness.\r\n\r\nConflict - 1:04\r\nThis section contains two keys, F major and G major, fighting each other in escalating conflict to represent the conflict between Celestia and Nightmare Moon.\r\n\r\nTorn Soul - 2:05\r\nThis section dives further in atonalism and shows us the anguish and pain in Celestia after she banishes her sister.\r\n\r\nJoy and Sorrow - 2:42\r\nThe final section of the piece includes a descending major line in 4/4 time to represent the joy of the ponies from Nightmare Moon's defeat. At the same time, the right hand plays a frantic line in the 3/8+2/4 time from the last section representing Celestia's continued anguish. This is also represented in the last two chords. The F major represents the celebration of the ponies through the Summer Sun Celebration while the quiet D minor represents Celestia's pain.\r\n\r\nArt: http://www.deviantart.com/art/I-ll-come-back-for-you-260799629"

Anyway, this was a fun song to make, halfway through I felt like is was really bad and though about just abandoning it. But in the end I think it turned out pretty good. Good enough for the princess of the night to use for her set. Hope you like it, Like, Comment, and Subscribe for more great hands-up and pony inspired music!!! I've also got a great collab that will be coming out soon so expect some more stuff.\r\n\r\nYoutube: http://youtu.be/7rqwRVdqB6c\r\nFree Download/Donate: https://djkadenza.bandcamp.com/track/lunar-dj\r\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/kadenza-hitti/kadenza-lunar-dj\r\nFacebook/Social Stuff: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kadenza/471118739676064?ref=hl\r\nChannel/Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC471V820Y6Zqu3N8u4wefww\r\n\r\nVarious Arts Used:\r\nMoon: http://reptituz.deviantart.com/art/Spyro-Sparx-and-Cynder-Under-The-Moon-Wallpaper-310940521\r\nHooded Luna: http://iphstich.deviantart.com/art/Luna-Princess-of-the-Night-354387128\r\nMane 6: http://tzolkine.deviantart.com/art/Mane-6-with-the-Elements-vector-315434477"

I started it shortly after watching the second Equestria Girls movie. I'm a sucker for a redemption story and Sunset is uber cute in that movie. Sooo sad too! I just want to give her a hug and tell her everything is gonna be fine. I tried to capture both her firey side and the sad side of her story in this track. The struggle is real yal.\r\n\r\nPic: Thanks to Ilona The Sinister for letting me use their awesome Sunset Shimmer graphic called \"The Three Forms of Sunset Shimmer.

Pretty much because the whole piece is based off of a first inversion A chord with an added 9th and why is the whole piece based of one chord you might ask? Because it's a minimalist piece. Minimalism is a very interesting style and is honestly one of my favorite styles of both visual art and music. Also, the style fits applejack so well in my mind. It conjures the image of routine and repetitive work, but a satisfying day on the farm for AJ."

People forced to leave their homes because of war, diseases or poverty. And other people just leaving for personal reasons. Or just sent to the moon for making your big sister mad.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think it would feel terribly bad to leave your home and your friends. But I also believe that we always find the strenght we need whithin our hearts.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening. Thanks for your support. But most important: thanks for your love. It has been an amazing year and I've made lots of friends around this fandom.\r\n\r\nCarry on, my ponies.

(sorry, not a holiday piece)\r\n\r\nThis is a piece that starts off simple in a chord inspired by Steve Reich's \"Electric Counterpoint\" with some woodwind and piano. The piece intensifies to the climax before calming down again back to the starting chord. In it I try to capture the affinity between the pegasi and the sky, to capture the comfort and intimate connection between the two.\r\n\r\nWatch and Subscribe on Youtube: http://youtu.be/rO8q2gk7IsA?list=UU4BcfaCIPAkUI54JjFbEtsQ\r\nDownload and Follow on Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/jbrewzy/sky\r\nSupport me on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/jbrewzy"

It's always an absolute pleasure working with you, good sir!  If you haven't already, make sure to go over, check out his stuff, and subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/user/DerpyCrash  He's a great musician and a pretty swell guy too!\r\n\r\nYoutube Link:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/qbMFU3kicfA\r\n\r\nAs always, free download over at Bandcamp:\r\nhttps://leafrunner.bandcamp.com/track/shampoo-factory\r\n\r\nSoundcloud Link:\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leafrunner/shampoo-factory\r\n\r\nWe've both been pretty heavy into chiptune lately, both in classic game soundtracks and original artists.  Here's kind of a level theme for the shampoo factory that serves as the Maneiac's lair, so to speak.  It can get a bit wild, kinda like her mane! Nostalgia for the SNES days, both in composition and the video.  \r\n\r\nDC made me learn FL Studio for this, so it was really my first dive into that.  It's nice being able to both work in the same DAW for once!  It was super fun working on this, I hope you guys enjoy as much as we did making it!  I'm sure we'll probably do another collab sometime in the future, we work well together.  I'm also down to maybe do some other collabs if I have the time.  My schedule's a bit all over the place right now, but drop me a message if interested!\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks so much for listening, commenting, subscribing.  You guys are the best!  Until next time, much love.  /)\r\n\r\nLeafRunner - Composition, Programming, Mixing\r\nDerpyCrash - Composition, Programming, Mastering, FL Studio Wizard Advice, Track Art\r\n\r\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is \u00a9Hasbro and The Hub."

About 1/3 of it was written while I was messing around on my piano and the other 2/3rd is somewhat inspired by Steve Reich's \"Electric Counterpoint.\"\r\n\r\nThis piece is split into 2 sections. The first section is called the \"awe\" section. It expresses the feeling of awe when one first encounters the Everfree Forest whether that awe is placed in beauty, size, or the amount of evil in such a forest.\r\n\r\nAt about a third of the way into the piece, the second section, the \"fear\" section, begins. This section is written in a minimalist style and expresses the growing feeling of fear and possibly a growing insanity from that fear as the section builds to the sudden climax at the end with no resolution to leave the listener wondering what happens after that. \r\n\r\nWhat happens to our explorer of this strange forest...\r\n\r\nCover Art is based off a screenshot from the show."

I wanted to explore that theme, as well as how language shapes our perception.\r\n\r\nIf you dig this, go over and read this story. It's definitely worth the time: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/81260/subjunctive\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nPurchase this tune: http://jexpsytrance.bandcamp.com/track/epistemic\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nInspired by the fanfic, Subjunctive, by Integral Archer.\r\nThanks to mlptf2mods, as always, for the isolated vocals.\r\nI don't even remember where the other quotes come from, to be honest.

Its pretty old. I think I wrote it either January or February this year. It's from when I used to write with a more baroque style. \r\nThe Chorale in the middle is a re-orchestrated version of \"Wer hat dich so geschlagen\" by J.S.

Well, it's the name of the southamerican brony convention that will be held in Per\u00fa on February 21. If you want to know more about it, please check the link below :3\r\n\r\nhttp://brohoofest.bropegworld.com/\r\n\r\nNow, about the song: you probably noticed that I tried to put as many as regional instruments and sounds that I could on this one to honor my southamerican culture.\r\nThe lyrics are inspired by that pretty pony you see in the cover art: Sari, brohoofest's official mascot. She has a very interesting story (wich hopefully you'll read in some comics once the convention starts) about unity, love, and all that pony stuff :3\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you like the song and want to support me, please consider downloading it at bandcamp :)\r\n\r\nhttps://tenderflutter.bandcamp.com/track/tu-presencia\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[SPANISH]\r\n\r\nComo est\u00e1 escrito en el t\u00edtulo, este track va a formar parte del Sountrack Oficial de la Brohoofest 2015.\r\n\r\nY qu\u00e9 es una brohoofest? Bueno, es el nombre de la convenci\u00f3n brony sudamericana a realizarse en Per\u00fa a partir del 21 de febrero. Si quer\u00e9s saber m\u00e1s sobre el asunto, date una vuelta por este link :3\r\n\r\nhttp://brohoofest.bropegworld.com/\r\n\r\nAhora sobre la canci\u00f3n: probablemente hayan notado que quise poner la mayor cantidad de instrumentos y sonidos aut\u00f3ctonos posibles, para honrar mi condici\u00f3n de sudamericano tambi\u00e9n.\r\nLa letra est\u00e1 inspirada en esa ponita que se ve en la imagen del video. Su nombre es Sari y ser\u00e1 la mascota oficial de la convenci\u00f3n. Tiene una linda historia que seguramente van a poder leer en algunos c\u00f3mics llegada la fecha de apertura del evento.\r\n\r\nUna cosa m\u00e1s, si te gust\u00f3 la canci\u00f3n y quieres ayudarme a continuar con mi trabajo, considera bajarla desde Bandcamp :3\r\n\r\nhttps://tenderflutter.bandcamp.com/track/tu-presencia\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[LETRA EN ESPA\u00d1OL / SPANISH LYRICS]\r\n\r\nSoy parte de un todo y un signo de paz \r\nuni\u00f3n de r\u00edos que llevan al mar \r\nllevo en mi canto la fuerza vital \r\npueblos del sol de leyenda ancestral \r\n\r\nVes lo que la uni\u00f3n ayud\u00f3 a construir \r\nd\u00eda en que todos estamos aqu\u00ed \r\nson los cimientos de otra realidad \r\ndos mundos s\u00ed pueden vivir en paz \r\n\r\nSiento tu voz en el valle \r\ny tu presencia en el aire \r\nsiento tu voz en el valle... \r\n\r\nEs el nacimiento de nuestra amistad \r\nbrillan los cielos y ruge el mar \r\nel sol y la luna testigos ser\u00e1n \r\nen armon\u00eda y en libertad \r\n\r\nSiento tu voz en el valle \r\ny tu presencia en el aire \r\nSiento tu voz en el valle...\r\n\r\nThat's all, my dear pony friends.

        "description": "Lyrics: Babs Seed is a bitch and a bully, if you snitch\r\nThen she\u2019ll fully separate your body from your head\r\nShe\u2019s a blank flank, but I think, to be frank,\r\nThe little filly can be scarier than an armored tank\r\nI wanna thank all the bullies in Manehatten\r\nFor causing this to happen, For bringing her to sadden\r\nThe fillies who did nothing but want to be her friend\r\nLittle Apple Bloom was so excited, don\u2019t pretend\r\nThat you didn\u2019t see the look, when that bully Babs took\r\nAway her dreams of friendship, and shook\r\nHer faith in the idea of the cutie mark crusaders,\r\nHaving fun adventures, dismissive of the haters\r\nBut she said \u201csee you later\u201d and joined the mean girls\r\nThe edge of a smile curls, a cruel grin then unfurls\r\n\u201cBlank flank\u201d she calls them, hypocritically so\r\nAnd with her newfound friends she turns away to go.\r\n\r\nBabs Seed, Babs Seed, Whatcha gonna do?\r\nGot a bully on your tail. Gotta hide, gotta bail.\r\nBabs Seed, Babs Seed, If she's after you,\r\nGotta run, gotta flee, gotta hurry, don't you see?\r\nBabs Seed, Babs Seed, just a bad, bad seed.\r\n\r\nBack home Babs didn\u2019t get attention,\r\nJust an everyday detention \u2018cuz she didn\u2019t wanna mention\r\nThat she didn\u2019t start the fight, all she ever did was end it\r\nGot a broken heart; mend it, and get ready to defend it\r\nOn the approval of her peers, she\u2019s emotionally dependant\r\nFor the things she has done, you might think she\u2019s unrepentant\r\nBut in truth she\u2019s afraid that the bullies have won\r\nIn the light of the sun, she has seen what she\u2019s become\r\nAll she wants to do is run from the evil she has done\r\nBut evil she\u2019s not, just confused and alone\r\nShe\u2019s a mess, and she\u2019s totally misguided\r\nIn the wake of her terror all she wants to do is hide it\r\nPut it back in the past where it can\u2019t come back\r\nBrighten up her heart to white from its former pitch black"

It's kinda compulsory for us, it's like an instinct that wakes up in the middle of the night and whispers \"hey... have you ever wanted to know how flying must feel?\" Of course, all these feelings come to me as I watch the pegasus fly, and particulary RD, always eager for more and more air and speed. \r\n\r\nAnd so here it is, after some weeks of hard work: Somewhere up here.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy :)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDownload this track in full quality via Bandcamp. \r\nhttps://tenderflutter.bandcamp.com/track/somewhere-up-here\r\n\r\nYour support is very important to me.

( https://www.youtube.com/user/EBC1Productions )\r\n\r\nIn one of the chapters of the book Kkat mentions this song being sung by Sapphire Shores. We wanted to know what it sounded like so here we are.\r\n\r\nSung by Metal-Mare. \r\nLyrics by Dalken Starbyne: https://www.youtube.com/user/dalkenstarbyne\r\nArt by Acesential: http://sta.sh/0pka3jz3lie\r\nBased on that crazy fan fiction we all either love or freak out about, Fallout: Equestria by Kkat: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html\r\n\r\nHere, have some lyrics:\r\n\r\nThis is the way that it has to be\r\nWhat I meant when I told you\r\nMy soul must be free\r\n\r\nThis is the way that it has to be\r\nWhen the whole world turns blue\r\nSo why can't you see?\r\n\r\nThings may seem bleak\r\nAnd your knees may be weak\r\nBut remember what I told you\r\nAll those years ago\r\n\r\nWhen the princess brings that big, old sun down\r\nAnd the moon comes out for the night\r\nAnd now that you can see her sister's crown\r\nYou should have nothing to fright\r\n\r\nBecause the sun can't hide forever\r\nIt doesn't matter wherever\r\nIt's never really gone\r\nAnd we'll still go on and on\r\n\r\nSo when you're feeling down\r\nAnd you're feeling blue\r\nAnd nothing goes the way you want it to\r\nJust remember what I told you\r\nJust remember what I told you\r\n\r\nBecause the sun can't hide forever\r\nIt doesn't matter wherever\r\nWith or without a princess\r\nWith or without our sight\r\nYou can always find your own sun inside\r\nTo take away the night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm telling you don't give up\r\nNo, don't give in\r\nYou're still in this\r\nAnd in it to win\r\n\r\nWithout me, you'll be fine\r\nFind your own light\r\nLet it shine\r\n\r\nWithout me, you'll be fine\r\nBecause the sun can't hide\r\nIt's right there inside\r\nSo the sun can't hide \r\nNo the sun can't hide\r\nForever"

        "description": "I don't really think Starlight Glimmer's philosophy has anything to do with Marxism. There's an element of equally shared resources, sure, but only because the ability to use those resources is also equal. And those equal ability is the reason Marxism doesn't really apply. Marxism requires individuals of exceptional ability in order to succeed, hence the maxim, \"from those according to their ability, to those according to their need.\" \r\n\r\nThis is something different. There's a laudable ideal within this philosophy: equal value to society. But this ideal is enforced through a totalitarian and vaguely disturbing regime. It contrasts with the Mane 6's friendship, which succeeds in creating equal value through understanding and embracing the differences that make us special. The fact that it is so similar to Twilight's values, but with a twist of totalitarianism, is owing to the episode's nature as a dystopia, a literary genre wherein a laudable ideal is achieved in a society through increasingly disquieting means. This can either be used to discredit the philosophy with that ideal at its core (Atlas Shrugged, Bioshock), or as a cautionary tale not to let idealism be co-opted by totalitarianism (1984, The Giver). In this case, it seems to be the latter.\r\n\r\nThis fusing of the ideals of harmony embraced by the show, with a totalitarian mindset, needs a different name from Marxism, or Communism, or any similar thing. It's its own philosophy. Just as totalitarian Communist regimes were often named after the leaders that imposed them (Stalinism, Maoism), I think it makes sense to call this philosophy Glimmerism.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArt by Cazra: http://cazra.deviantart.com/art/Equality-525055371\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks as always to mlptf2mods for their amazing vocal only audio.

        "description": "Doc's passion for science in Slice of Life really resonated with me, and I liked how it was cast as an alternate philosophy from magic. I always felt that the approach of magic in Equestria was a kind of brute force, make the cosmos do your bidding, thing, and science is more about understanding what happens when you don't try to impose your will on the environment. \r\n\r\nBut, as Arthur C. Clark said, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and as Agatha Heterodyne said, any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science. Really, this is at the core of my own headcanon regarding the relationship between magic and science in Equestria. \r\n\r\nI also liked that, for all of the references to Doctor Who, Doc is adamantly not just The Doctor in this story. He's his own character with his own background and motivations. He just happens to have a very Doctor-like eccentricity to him. \r\n\r\nFun fact: That lead at the end was inspired when I leaned back in my char while working on this tune, and the piece of junk sqeaked really loudly, and I was like, \"I don't remember making that synth!\" But it sounded cool, so I put it in.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPurchase this tune: https://jexpsytrance.bandcamp.com/track/one-and-the-same\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtwork by Muketti: muketti.deviantart.com/art/I-am-the-sand-in-the-bottom-half-of-the-hourglass-524905181 \r\n\r\nSources Sampled: \r\nMLP FiM S5E9: Slice of Life \r\nThor \r\n\r\nBig thanks to mlptf2mods, as always, for always being bros and bringing that swag voice only audio."

And these lyrics are a tribute to a future life in Equestria with lots of friendly ponies. :) \r\n\r\nCREDIT FOR INSTRUMENTAL BELONGS TO ORIGINAL ARTIST AND RENDERER. \r\nBackground: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:Train_headed_for_Ponyville_S3E2.png \r\nTwilight Vector: http://theshadowstone.deviantart.com/art/Princess-Twilight-in-Flight-416212698\r\nLyrics: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QqwOcSFvdEeneJkw6Yc7V_tk8TJ6hKNzRjFt-vmc0ro&authuser=0"

        "description": "VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyx4BPXvGQ\r\n\r\nThis is our 6th music video, and is our most involved musical production to date.  Overall the song is inspired by Discord and the many aspects of his personality.  Each section portrays a different element of his motivations and behavior.  Although we have our own specific ideas of what the sections mean, it\u2019s up to you to interpret them on your own!  We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts in the comment section.\r\n\r\nWith each song, we try to do something new and a little different.  For this one we decided to perform the piece as an instrumental with no lyrical content, allowing the melodies alone to tell the story. Additionally, we switched up the band\u2019s lineup a little bit for the first time: Dylzal played bass guitar and PlunderSteed played piano and synths.  Finally, this is also the first time we\u2019ve taken a distributed approach to the songwriting.  Each member wrote a different section, then presented it to the other members to critique and tweak to ensure it flowed with the rest of the composition.  At nearly 12 minutes in length, it is by far our longest piece yet.  This production was very challenging in ways that we did not anticipate, since it frequently put us outside of our comfort zones.\r\n\r\nA separate video will be available in the coming week, where we share our thoughts on the nitty gritty parts of the production.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the song, and we look forward to answering your questions.  As this video goes live, we are already almost halfway through recording our next song, and we have even begun writing the song that will be released after that.\r\n\r\nAlbum Art: http://www.deviantart.com/art/Discord-288082125\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nDylzal: Lead Guitar, Bass, Drum Arrangements\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjX7d1UgizdzFcWaRvNLdYw\r\n\r\nSxp: Rhythm Guitar\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sxpgt\r\n\r\nPlunderSteed: Piano and Synths\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/PlunderSteed\r\n\r\nDiscord: Vocals\r\n%#&#^36$#(#)????"

        "description": "I like Luna. I like dark, trippy shit. This had to happen. I really liked DPDMS, not just because it was a Luna episode, but because of the way it used metaphorical imagery to convey some very complex and difficult to explain psychological processes. In particular how Luna both literally and figuratively internalized her guilt by bringing the Tantibus into herself. That's some heavy shit. \r\n\r\nThis tune's not really about that, though. It's more of an Alternate Universe, what if Luna had not succeeded, kind of thing. The Tantibus getting out of the dream world is a kinda terrifying concept. So have some scary minimal dark psytrance.\r\n\r\nAlso, gosh, it's been some time since my last post. I apologize, particularly because it's mostly been me being lazy, but I've also been really busy getting ready to ship out for Basic Training with the Army. I ship out on the twentieth, and that's 9 weeks, so expect a bit of silence for the next couple months. After that, I intend to get back into making music whenever I have free time, so don't expect me to disappear entirely.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPurchase this tune:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtwork by Winternachts: http://www.deviantart.com/art/Nemesis-Me-559696892\r\n\r\nSources Sampled: \r\nMLP FiM S5E13: Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep\r\n\r\nBig thanks to mlptf2mods, as always, for always being bros and bringing that swag voice only audio."

Well this is a musician you may or may not have know in your whole entire life heck you probably just discovered this site and thought to yourself what is the pony fandom and why is are these songs about ponies. I may not be the same person as I am now when you speak to me but please do when ever you can. \r\n\r\n\r\nWell good luck and farewell Equestrian Beats until we meet again xD"

        "description": "VIDEO: https://youtu.be/15LlAsNkksg\r\n\r\nFor this release, we go back to a Brony classic, Flutterwonder.\r\n\r\nThe song is well known for it use of sentence mixing from the song 'So Many Wonders' in order to create a melody that is very different from the original. But the song also has other admirable qualities, including being very well paced and musically being very graceful and beautiful.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be fun to do a cover of this song, as not only did I like the song itself, but I thought it would a challenge for me to make an arrangement of a song that uses only 4 chords that is well paced and doesn't get repetitive. I actually made this arrangement 5 months ago. When I showed it to the others we were still working on Discord and we obviously couldn't shift our attention onto it. Recently though, we decided that if we wanted to start making more videos and music we would have have to start putting less focus on having everyone in the videos, so everyone didn't have to play catch up when learning all the material. So this time, it's just me...oh, and Andrea Libman for voicing Fluttershy for me :P\r\n\r\nAlternative Download:\r\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/draconequus-band/flutterwonder (MP3)\r\n\r\nOriginal by PinkiePieSwear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viTkj...\r\nB-roll: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfj0G...\r\nThumbnail: (Internet's going super slow where I am, I'll but sort this out later)\r\n________________________________________\u00ad________________________\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\n\r\n...Should I even bother...\r\n...nah"
