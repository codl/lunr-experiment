That makes sense, right?\r\n\r\nLyrics: \r\nBeneath the earth under the dirt / below the subterranean passages\r\npast the masses of the black facets / It is the land hid in the back\r\nBeyond the track, deep into the depths of the darkest of all paths. \r\n\r\nWe are a race of ravenous wrath beings.\r\nSome fast feeding, furious mad heaving get that ass beaten.. \r\nAnd that's meaning you passed the first meeting, and by pass\r\nI mean you last - the rip & thrash greeting. \r\n\r\nOur calling cards are shards of gems - bound around our necks. \r\nEmbedded in leather, a sign of respect.\r\nAnd the better and more precious a gem is.\r\nThe more venomous and more likely to wreck - that veteran is. \r\n\r\nAnd we are pack minded. Meaning Omegas straight attack \r\nWhile the Alphas plan ahead designing trap mines.\r\nThese fine devices devised by wry bastards. \r\nAnd you will find in these Mine Shafts - divine Masters \r\n\r\nWe the diamond dogs, our dog diamonds\r\nglimmer underneath the dim of Earth and keep shining.\r\nSo keep an eye on your rocks, or you'll get rocked on. \r\nThese dogs are off of the leash, and you'll get dogged on. \r\n\r\nWho let the dogs out?\r\nWho let the dogs out?\r\nWho let the dogs out?\r\nWe let the dogs out! \r\n\r\nBetter climb if you find yourself lost here. \r\nWe the canines that dine upon your heart's fear. \r\n\r\nI won't stop you, becoming self independent. \r\nIf you want to venture into the pit, then go ahead and \r\nDon't blame me if you fall off a cliff or get beheaded. \r\nCause you Dance with the Dogs - admit - your life has ended. \r\n\r\nBeen in the clutches of the dogs before. \r\nI've seen their fury underground like they gods of war. \r\nSoulless beasts who can gorge and feast upon the living. \r\nCerberus has a far better chance to be forgiving\r\nNow, there is another who survived this feat.. \r\nAn urban legend of girl who connived and schemed.\r\nInstead of pleading for her life, she decides to treat \r\nthem to a mind trick, and in the end defies their greed.\r\n\r\nA rare breed of a beautiful sly manipulator. \r\nAnd confined as a prisoner, doesn't try to escape\r\nBuys time with confusion, until her friends can save her \r\nWhen in fact, it's the dogs whose dying to separate her. \r\n\r\n//CHORUS//\r\n\r\nIt's a rare case, so - let it marinate. \r\nGo tell your pony friends - that this Mare's great. \r\nGo share that Diamond Dogs got all their nerves grated. \r\nAnd that one pony was more than they anticipated.\r\n\r\nAnd that within one day she was the most hated. \r\nAnd that this chance occurence was truly ill fated.\r\nAnd that a pony's whining is simply understated. \r\nA Rarity indeed - it cannot be debated. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nhttp://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/309/7/a/diamond_dogs_are_gonna_getcha_...\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17PM-UMVud8\r\nhttp://el-grimlock.deviantart.com/art/Werewolf-Warrior-255138248"

(louder harp as it gos on for 2 messures) Fluttershy is calming down but as she looks around she knows anything could happen her fears come back (loud music comes back) she then remembers how her friends would always tell her she is strong and can do anything (the hard music stops it gets soft) its just like the beginning she is happy and nothing can stop her"

However things are not as he imagined, and he quickly discovers himself locked in a never ending nightmare, his only wish to return home from where he came, but was he in Equestria to begin with?\r\n\r\nI end up thinking some interesting stories when making music.\r\n\r\nGenre: ? Probably a mutated baby from the mating of psytrance and industrial."

Just she and the open skies with warm sunrays...\r\n\r\n_____\r\nEpic Spitfire art made by SerenaKKS: http://fav.me/d5436tj\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD MP3 (320kbps): \r\nBUY HQ: http://nicolasdominique.bandcamp.com/track/sunset-flight (1$)\r\nGENRE: Chillout Trance || BPM: 140\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nVISIT MY OTHER PAGES:\r\nDeviantART: http://niklasshepherd.deviantart.com/\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003994281794\r\nSoundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/nicolas-dominique\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/99plusmusic\r\nTumblr: http://n-dominique.tumblr.com/"

Normally when I want to remix a song, I work around the acapella, but instead I decided to make the song first (well part of it), then have the acapella work around it. I must say, this worked out a thousand times better, less stress, and finished faster. Although I missed the good ol times of finding out what to do.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you guys like this. This is so far my favorite remix that I've done so far and I'm starting to better familiarize myself with Fruity Loops Studio. Hope you enjoy this.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks to generalzoi for the pony maker. Probably should've made my cutie mark a music note or general dj gear cause I'm not exactly a turntablist but meh, I'll go with it.

The loser has to cover something that the winner chooses. Knowing that I like Celestia more than Luna, he chose \"For The New Lunar Republic\" by NACP. This had to be finished within 24 hours. Well what do you know, 12 hours later, 8 hours of sleep, and a 30 minute final, I still managed to whip out this song. I not going to lose as a pyro against a spy again. Not by 20 points. \r\n\r\nThe cover's in my usual style, and luckily the song is so easy to cover I can create my own midis in about 30 minutes, and finish the song in 3 hours. Much shorter than the days that it usually takes when I compose from scratch. \r\n\r\nSince I can't contact NACP, I have decided to donate 100% of the proceeds of this cover to the Seeds of Kindness.

Hopefully this is a track that tells us a little bit about ourselves, and who we are, or at least makes you think about it what many of those reasons could be. Hopefully a track you could play for a Trekkie or a parent and they might understand us better or be interested. Glad our track came together as it did and I hope you enjoy it.

HHNNGGG!!!!\" With that being said and the fact that I love Applejack more than the other 5, I was extremely hesitant to remix it cause I didn't want to mess it up. I saw some people remixing it in all genres (first I listened to was metapony's metal cover) and decided to just go for it.\r\n\r\nThis took...a while to finish really. In any case, when I finished the house portion, I decided to try something new and make another genre within the remix, happy hardcore of course :P.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I hope you guys like this ^_^\r\nYoutube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkIsbXVgjXM"

I've been feeling... \"Homesick\"... ...for Equestria.\r\n\r\nI can't really explain it... but that doesn't make the feelings any less real.\r\n\r\nSo, when I heard \"Isle of Inisfree,\" a Celtic song about a displaced soul longing for their home... I knew just had to rewrite it to match how I was feeling.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever felt this too... I hope this song makes the longing a little easier knowing that there are others who feel it as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nI've met some folks who say that I'm a dreamer,\r\nAnd I've no doubt there's truth in what they say,\r\nBut sure a body's bound to be a dreamer,\r\nWhen all the things she loves are far away.\r\nAnd precious things are dreams unto an exile.\r\nThey bring her home to a land so magical\r\nAnd in her heart she's once again pony,\r\nIn her dear lovely home, Equestria.\r\n\r\nWhen this world's moon rises beyond the rooftops,\r\nOf this great city, with wonders near and far,\r\nI scarcely feel the bright lights or the turmoil...\r\nI'm home again in my Equestria.\r\n\r\nI wander o'er green hills through dreamy valleys,\r\nAnd find a peace no other land would know.\r\nI hear the birds make music fit for angels,\r\nAnd watch the rivers laughing as they flow.\r\nAnd back to Ponyville my hooves they take me,\r\nMy dear old home and tenderly behold,\r\nPonies I love around the village, gathered.\r\nAnd I relive their friendships young and old.\r\n\r\nBut dreams don't last\r\nThough friends are not forgotten\r\nAnd soon I'm back to harsh reality.\r\nBut even if they paved the roads with gold here,\r\nI still would choose my dear Equestria.\r\n"

Pegasus Pitch helped me a lot again, this time critiquing my singing and editing again (thank you sooooooo much by the way). He even put his own project on hold for me (you didn't have to do that btw). His selfless actions WILL BE remember!

My mixing and mastering is far from acceptable for a professional (dare I say post)-rock song This is a messy track, its dissonant, sometimes off, but I like it. And that's what my music is about.

So I've concentrated on what I though was the best part of the season, musically, which was all the wonderful music from the finale. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nAll guitars, bass, drum programming and orchestral programming / arrangements by me (The L-Train). All music written by Daniel Ingram and William Anderson.

FOLLOW HER TUMBLR NOW! http://askdragonfly.tumblr.com/ DO IT!\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly i feel like thsi should be a sub special\r\n\r\nBackstory of the song\r\nThis song is actually a few things. The first verse is actually about brony rappers that look down at what they do. It was me saying that no matter what it's about if you have the skill you have the skill. It's that simple. What you're doing maybe different or wierd but that just means it's unique!\r\nThe second verse and third verse's were both directed at me on the other hand. The second being about the performance i have coming up and how i'm actually nervous due to the content of what i'm performing. The third verse is asking myself what i'm gonna do about it. ending the verse by saying i'm going to live. \r\n\r\nThis is the song that is planned to end my set for my performance on the 27th so i felt the last verse i should try and get the audience involved as well! This is one of my favorite songs i've done amazing for fans of MLP and non!\r\n\r\nTo my fans (Or haters) thank you! You all made every verse i've ever rapped worth it! To my friends, you helped make this a AMAZING roller coaster that i had the chance to hop on. All the ups and downs that it's put us through, they were fun and we can look back at them and laugh! So where it takes me  or any of us may still be a mystery but i have a feeling that we're all gonna enjoy it. \r\n\r\nFinally to Orion! You and me HAVE to do another collab in the future! You're fucking amazing and without you this song wouldn't be NEAR as good as it is right now!\r\n\r\nFollow me at Twitter https://twitter.com/Versal17\r\n\r\nTumblr http://versal-chronic.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\nEQB https://eqbeats.org/user/340"

I had Assertive Fluttershy's melody stuck in my head a couple days ago, and I looked around to see that no one had really done a full-fledged, proper length epic trance remix of the track. I decided that simply wouldn't do, and got to work on this one. Synesthesia (Fly Away), by The Thrillseekers, was a big inspiration for the synth line, incidentally.\r\n\r\nOriginal: \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJY6T2MdBmI\r\n\r\nMany thanks (as always) to mlptf2mods.com for having all of the vocal only stuff I could ever need.\r\nhttp://www.mlptf2mods.com/create/reference-materials"

The piece of music has four parts, while the ending just refers to the beginning. First the string section starts off with melancholic harmonies, then a lonely flute plays a melody that reflects all the suffering caused by corruption and war. The first part permanently rises to a beseeching exclaimation, just before the world of Luna Republik shows an other side: the war and the omnipresent fear. Not many words are necessary to express the horror, but instead there is a change again... maybe there is something positive left?\r\nA secluded melody draws a different image of this world, even though the apparent idyll in the middle of chaos does not survive long before being overtaken by suffering and the piece slowly vanishing into silence..."

They always seem to come out so much better than my electronic-rock songs do; or maybe I just like making these more =P. The point is that I'm dropping ANY Electronic project I had in the workings including my next album, Pride and Flame and the CMC EP, although I may make some trance-like song for the 3 of them for that one instead.\r\n\r\nNow then, this track I went to capture an image of aomeone gazing up at a starry sky with wonder and awe,and in the end this song came out simply beautifully ^^. Most likely, I'll start working on a Trance style album now, so look forward to more songs like this from now on, Trance songs are just so artistic and beautiful as well as a joy to make, no other style I've done makes me feel quite as proud of it as this song does, so I hope you all enjoy!"

Well, it's the name of the southamerican brony convention that will be held in Per\u00fa on February 21. If you want to know more about it, please check the link below :3\r\n\r\nhttp://brohoofest.bropegworld.com/\r\n\r\nNow, about the song: you probably noticed that I tried to put as many as regional instruments and sounds that I could on this one to honor my southamerican culture.\r\nThe lyrics are inspired by that pretty pony you see in the cover art: Sari, brohoofest's official mascot. She has a very interesting story (wich hopefully you'll read in some comics once the convention starts) about unity, love, and all that pony stuff :3\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you like the song and want to support me, please consider downloading it at bandcamp :)\r\n\r\nhttps://tenderflutter.bandcamp.com/track/tu-presencia\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[SPANISH]\r\n\r\nComo est\u00e1 escrito en el t\u00edtulo, este track va a formar parte del Sountrack Oficial de la Brohoofest 2015.\r\n\r\nY qu\u00e9 es una brohoofest? Bueno, es el nombre de la convenci\u00f3n brony sudamericana a realizarse en Per\u00fa a partir del 21 de febrero. Si quer\u00e9s saber m\u00e1s sobre el asunto, date una vuelta por este link :3\r\n\r\nhttp://brohoofest.bropegworld.com/\r\n\r\nAhora sobre la canci\u00f3n: probablemente hayan notado que quise poner la mayor cantidad de instrumentos y sonidos aut\u00f3ctonos posibles, para honrar mi condici\u00f3n de sudamericano tambi\u00e9n.\r\nLa letra est\u00e1 inspirada en esa ponita que se ve en la imagen del video. Su nombre es Sari y ser\u00e1 la mascota oficial de la convenci\u00f3n. Tiene una linda historia que seguramente van a poder leer en algunos c\u00f3mics llegada la fecha de apertura del evento.\r\n\r\nUna cosa m\u00e1s, si te gust\u00f3 la canci\u00f3n y quieres ayudarme a continuar con mi trabajo, considera bajarla desde Bandcamp :3\r\n\r\nhttps://tenderflutter.bandcamp.com/track/tu-presencia\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[LETRA EN ESPA\u00d1OL / SPANISH LYRICS]\r\n\r\nSoy parte de un todo y un signo de paz \r\nuni\u00f3n de r\u00edos que llevan al mar \r\nllevo en mi canto la fuerza vital \r\npueblos del sol de leyenda ancestral \r\n\r\nVes lo que la uni\u00f3n ayud\u00f3 a construir \r\nd\u00eda en que todos estamos aqu\u00ed \r\nson los cimientos de otra realidad \r\ndos mundos s\u00ed pueden vivir en paz \r\n\r\nSiento tu voz en el valle \r\ny tu presencia en el aire \r\nsiento tu voz en el valle... \r\n\r\nEs el nacimiento de nuestra amistad \r\nbrillan los cielos y ruge el mar \r\nel sol y la luna testigos ser\u00e1n \r\nen armon\u00eda y en libertad \r\n\r\nSiento tu voz en el valle \r\ny tu presencia en el aire \r\nSiento tu voz en el valle...\r\n\r\nThat's all, my dear pony friends.

        "description": "Doc's passion for science in Slice of Life really resonated with me, and I liked how it was cast as an alternate philosophy from magic. I always felt that the approach of magic in Equestria was a kind of brute force, make the cosmos do your bidding, thing, and science is more about understanding what happens when you don't try to impose your will on the environment. \r\n\r\nBut, as Arthur C. Clark said, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and as Agatha Heterodyne said, any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science. Really, this is at the core of my own headcanon regarding the relationship between magic and science in Equestria. \r\n\r\nI also liked that, for all of the references to Doctor Who, Doc is adamantly not just The Doctor in this story. He's his own character with his own background and motivations. He just happens to have a very Doctor-like eccentricity to him. \r\n\r\nFun fact: That lead at the end was inspired when I leaned back in my char while working on this tune, and the piece of junk sqeaked really loudly, and I was like, \"I don't remember making that synth!\" But it sounded cool, so I put it in.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPurchase this tune: https://jexpsytrance.bandcamp.com/track/one-and-the-same\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtwork by Muketti: muketti.deviantart.com/art/I-am-the-sand-in-the-bottom-half-of-the-hourglass-524905181 \r\n\r\nSources Sampled: \r\nMLP FiM S5E9: Slice of Life \r\nThor \r\n\r\nBig thanks to mlptf2mods, as always, for always being bros and bringing that swag voice only audio."
